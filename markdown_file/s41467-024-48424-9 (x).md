### Currently responsible for over one fifth of carbon emissions worldwide, the transportation sector will need to undergo a substantial technological transi- tion to ensure compatibility with global climate goals. Few studies have modeled strategies to achieve zero emissions across all transportation modes, including aviation and shipping, alongside an integrated analysis of feedbacks on other sectors and environmental systems. Here, we use a global integrated assessment model to evaluate deep decarbonization scenarios for the trans- portation sector consistent with maintaining end-of-century warming below 1.5 °C, considering varied timelines for fossil fuel phase-out and implementa- tion of advanced alternative technologies. We highlight the leading low carbon technologies for each transportation mode, finding that electrification con- tributes most to decarbonization across the sector. Biofuels and hydrogen are particularly important for aviation and shipping. Our most ambitious scenario eliminates transportation emissions by mid-century, contributing sub- stantially to achieving climate targets but requiring rapid technological shifts with integrated impacts on fuel demands and availability and upstream energy transitions.


Due to its dependence on oil as a fuel and the distributed nature of
resulting emissions, the transportation sector is one of the most
challenging sectors to fully decarbonize [1][–][3] . The sector has been found
to respond more slowly than other sectors to the imposition of climate
policy such as a carbon tax, leading to relatively large residual emissions that must be offset with CO 2 removal under net zero emissions
goals [4][–][8] . Substantial progress has been made in passenger road
transport with the increasing development and adoption of electric
light-duty vehicles [9][–][11], and batteries and hydrogen fuel cells offer
potential for road freight vehicles [2][,][12] . However, low emissions technologies for maritime shipping and aviation are nascent owing to the
large quantities of energy-dense fuel required for their long-distance
travel [2][,][10][,][12][,][13] . Efforts to rapidly decarbonize these modes are further
complicated by long vehicle lifespans and, for aviation in particular,
the need for a dependable fuel supply that can ensure safety and
sustain operations at cruising altitude [2][,][10] . Aviation and shipping


together produced about a quarter of global transportation emissions
in 2015, with this share projected to increase, especially under stringent climate mitigation scenarios that induce rapid integration of zero
emissions road vehicles [13][–][15] . Thus, achieving deep decarbonization in
the transportation sector will depend on the development of emerging
low carbon technologies for aviation and shipping.
Despite their importance for meeting climate goals, few studies
have analyzed mitigation strategies for the full transportation sector,
including aviation and shipping, in the context of global, economywide decarbonization. While there are a variety of industry scenarios
and analyses for aviation and shipping decarbonization in
isolation [13][,][16][–][22], these do not employ an integrated framework that
considers the connections between the transportation sector and
other sectors and environmental systems. Such a framework is
important as it allows for an assessment of the upstream emissions
from transportation as well as the implications of transportation fuel

use for land use and fuel availability for other sectors. Studies of
transportation decarbonization that do incorporate interactions with
the full economy are mostly restricted to a regional level [4][,][11][,][14][,][23][–][28],
aggregate the entire transport sector [29], focus primarily on road
vehicles [1][,][5][,][11][,][26][,][28][,][30], or only observe limited mitigation in aviation and
shipping [8][,][11][,][15][,][31][–][35], often due to a lack of modeled options for technologies that could decarbonize these modes. Other work has assessed
deep decarbonization in aviation and freight transport with economywide modeling, but without an evaluation of the relative contributions
of different low carbon fuels to this decarbonization [2][,][6][,][36] . Recent

commitments to ambitious net zero carbon emissions targets by
aviation and shipping trade associations and national and international
organizations [16][,][37][–][40] further highlight the need for a better understanding of how aggressive emissions reductions by these modes can
be achieved alongside decarbonization measures in other transportation modes and sectors.

To take up this question, we use the Global Change Analysis
Model (GCAM) version 6.0 to examine decarbonization scenarios for
the entire global transportation sector consistent with limiting end-ofcentury warming to 1.5 °C. GCAM is a global integrated assessment
model that links the energy system, water, land, and the climate, and
has a highly detailed treatment of the transportation sector [6][,][8][,][30][,][32][,][33][,][36] .
We consider decarbonization strategies for all modes of passenger and
freight transportation represented in GCAM (Supplementary Fig. 1) but
focus particularly on analyzing pathways for aviation and shipping. We
examine high, medium, and low ambition scenarios, with higher
degrees of ambition corresponding to higher levels of elimination of
traditional fossil fuels and adoption of advanced alternative technologies (Table 1). The high ambition scenario considers a complete
phase-out of fossil fuels from the transportation sector by 2050. The
medium scenario delays the elimination of fossil fuels in transportation until 2100, while the low scenario does not impose sector-specific
requirements for the decarbonization of transport. These varied
degrees of ambition allow for an evaluation of the integrated system
responses resulting from different levels of realization of climate goals
in the transportation sector, spanning the range of the most aggressive
decarbonization targets that have been set by industry leaders [37][–][40]

(high scenario) to the minimum goals agreed upon by international
organizations [41][,][42] (medium and low scenarios).
Along with these technological shifts, we also assume reduced
demand for transportation services, increased ridesharing, and
increased public transportation use. We hold these demand-side
assumptions constant across our three decarbonization scenarios to
isolate the effects of the varied level of technological ambition. We pair
the changes in the transportation sector with additional technological
and behavioral changes across other sectors of the economy that
facilitate greenhouse gas mitigation, in line with the 1.5 °C scenario
from Gambhir et al. [43] and the 1.5 °C “sectoral strengthening” scenario
from Fuhrman et al. [44] (see Methods for details) [43][,][44] . These shifts are
aligned with or surpass the “sustainability” scenario (SSP1) from the
Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) [45][,][46] . We employ a global carbon emissions constraint that ensures end-of-century warming is
below 1.5 °C and that is consistent with the Sixth Assessment Report
(AR6) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)
emissions scenarios Category 1 (Limit warming to 1.5 °C (>50%) with no
or limited overshoot) [47] . For comparison with our decarbonization
scenarios, we also consider a reference scenario corresponding to a
continuation of current trends and technological developments and in
which no climate policy is implemented (Table 1). We maintain the
same population and GDP growth assumptions (both following SSP1)
in the reference scenario as in the decarbonization scenarios (Supplementary Fig. 2) to avoid confounding effects of varied socioeconomic pathways on transportation and resource demands across
scenarios.

We supplement GCAM’s existing low carbon technology options
for the transportation sector (hydrogen, electricity, and biofuels) by
adding e-fuels, or synthetic hydrocarbon liquids produced from carbon captured from the atmosphere (see Methods for details). While we
consider a full phase-out of liquid fuels in road and rail transportation
in our medium and high scenarios, for aviation and shipping we allow
liquid fuel use to continue but mandate that this fuel derive from
biomass or atmospheric carbon origins rather than fossil fuels
(Table 1). A variety of biofuel production technologies exist, with
multiple options modeled in GCAM; we specifically require biofuels
used in aviation and shipping to be produced via Fischer-Tropsch (FT)
synthesis using cellulosic biomass feedstocks. This design choice was
made in light of sustainability concerns associated with the direct use
of food crops to produce fuel (e.g., corn ethanol, soybean biodiesel)
and the suitability of the resulting fuel for use in aviation and
shipping [25][,][36][,][48][–][50] . We also impose a constraint on global bioenergy use
of 100 EJ by 2100 to address additional environmental concerns related to land competition between biomass cultivation, food


generated by all other models shown in gray). The number of scenarios from the
database with results for each subset of transportation modes is indicated by the
number in gray at the top of each panel. Note that the GCAM scenarios in the AR6
database employed earlier versions of GCAM than the version used in this study,
and thus the scenarios may differ in historical periods due to differences in calibration data and other model updates. For a comparable figure showing fuel use by

production, and natural lands [51][–][53], and to attempt to direct biomass
consumption towards the highest-value use cases.
## Results
#### Consequences for transportation emissions

All decarbonization scenarios achieve deep economy-wide emissions
reductions, bringing global mean warming below 1.5 °C by the end of
the century (Supplementary Fig. 3). However, the contribution of the
transportation sector to these emissions reductions varies between
the scenarios (Fig. 1a, b). In the reference scenario, direct emissions
from the transportation sector increase by more than 40% from 2020
to 2100. In contrast, direct emissions are eliminated by 2050 in the
high transportation technology scenario, with total emissions (direct
and indirect) reduced by 99% relative to 2020 (Supplementary Fig. 4).
The medium and low transportation technology scenarios maintain
residual emissions from transport after 2050, with totals of 39 Gt CO 2
and 157 Gt CO 2, respectively, of cumulative residual emissions from
2050 to 2100. If these residual emissions were counterbalanced with

direct air capture (DAC) to achieve economy-wide net zero goals,
associated costs would be on the order of $7-14 trillion in the medium
scenario and $27-54 trillion in the low scenario (see Supplementary
Table 1 for DAC cost assumptions). Over the course of the century, the
high scenario lowers sector-wide direct emissions by 675 Gt CO 2
relative to the reference scenario, and by 245 Gt CO 2 relative to the low
scenario (Fig. 1b, Supplementary Table 2); the latter value represents
about 60% of the carbon budget consistent with a two-thirds chance of
limiting warming to 1.5 °C according to the IPCC AR6 report [54] . Non-CO 2
and air pollutant emissions also decline correspondingly across our
scenarios, with particularly large reductions in CO and NOx emissions
(Supplementary Table 3).
By mode, freight trucks and passenger cars and trucks have the
largest absolute emissions savings in the high scenario relative to the
low scenario over the course of the century (78 Gt CO 2 and 70 Gt CO 2,
respectively), while long-haul and short-haul aviation see the largest
percent reductions in cumulative emissions (77% and 75%, respectively). Together, aviation and shipping reduce their emissions by 83
Gt CO 2 over the century in the high scenario compared to the low
scenario, contributing 34% of the total emissions savings from the
transportation sector.
Figure 1c shows transportation CO 2 emissions in our decarbonization scenarios compared to scenarios in the AR6 database
that achieve the 1.5 °C temperature goal by 2100 [55] . For the full transportation sector, our high and medium transportation technology
scenarios are well below the median level of emissions from the AR6

scenarios in both 2050 and 2100. Our low scenario is near the median

in 2050 but above it in 2100. While there are more than 300 scenarios

that model emissions pathways for the combined transportation sector, only 14 scenarios include a detailed breakdown of these transportation sector emissions into aviation, shipping, rail, and road
transport. Relative to those scenarios, our high scenario is more
ambitious, most notably in aviation and shipping; the scenarios in the
AR6 database do not achieve zero emissions from these modes until

2075 or later.
#### Contributions of each low carbon technology

The ambitious reductions in transportation emissions in the high
scenario are the result of rapid technological transitions across the
sector, which are shown in Fig. 2. In the high scenario, most modes
are primarily electrified by 2050 onwards, with the exceptions of
international shipping and long-haul aviation. International shipping
relies principally on hydrogen; it is the only mode for which a larger
fraction of service (i.e., transportation activity, in passengerkilometers or ton-kilometers) is supplied by hydrogen technologies
than electric technologies by 2050. Alternative liquid fuels also play a
key role in international shipping, particularly in the first half of the
century when hydrogen technologies are still emergent. In long-haul
aviation, the high costs of using electric batteries or hydrogen
combustion systems on long haul flights—barring significant invest
—
ments in and advancements of these technologies prevent both
technologies from taking off, leading to a dependence on alternative
liquid fuels to meet decarbonization targets. These fuels provide
over 88% of long-haul aviation service from 2050 onwards in the high
scenario. Though these alternative fuels can consist of either biofuels
or e-fuels, we find that e-fuels are far less cost-competitive than
biofuels (Supplementary Fig. 5) and thus comprise a relatively low
fraction of the alternative liquid fuel mix for aviation and shipping
(<16% across all years in the primary scenarios). Unlike its long-haul
counterpart, short-haul aviation employs a more balanced portfolio
of technologies, with electricity providing 56% of service in 2050 and
hydrogen and alternative liquid fuels contributing almost evenly to
the remainder. In domestic shipping, electricity is dominant, supplying over 80% of service from 2050 onwards in the high scenario;
the speed with which this transition occurs implies both a high


potential for electrification and an elevated risk of short-haul freight
vessels becoming stranded assets.
While these rapid shifts in aviation and shipping technologies will
be costly, we find that they could—for most modes—be economically
viable in the context of ambitious mitigation goals. By 2050, estimated
break-even carbon prices for electric and hydrogen-based technologies (i.e., the carbon prices that would make them cost-competitive
with traditional fossil-based technologies) for shipping and short-haul
aviation range from 135 to 496 2020$ per tCO 2 (Supplementary

–
Table 4), comparable to projected DAC costs of 172 351 2020$ per
tCO 2 in that year (Supplementary Table 1). Electrifying domestic ships,
and employing hydrogen fuel cells on international ones, stand out as
becoming cost-competitive at a carbon price of less than 250 2020$
per tCO 2 . Break-even carbon prices for electric and hydrogen-based
long-haul aviation are high (>1300 2020$ per tCO 2 ), further indicative
of the financial support and/or substantial technological development
required for viability.
Considering other modes, passenger cars and trucks, freight
trucks, and passenger and freight rail exhibit high levels of electrification, with hydrogen providing the remainder of service after
2050. Buses rely more substantially on hydrogen than the other modes
of road transport, consistent with previous findings [56], with a split of
about 44% hydrogen-based service and 56% electricity-based service
from 2050 onwards. Note that the steep declines in bus and passenger
rail service observed in Fig. 2 occur due to the income-driven shift
towards faster modes with lower wait times as global per capita GDP
increases; the elevated preference for public transit implemented in
our decarbonization scenarios acts against this trend, resulting in a
higher share of total vehicle-kilometers for passenger transport provided by buses and rail than in the reference scenario (Supplementary
Fig. 6), but does not fully counteract it.
#### Differences in technology mix and service across scenarios

Relative to the high scenario, the low and medium scenarios are less
ambitious in their scale-up of emerging technologies. Figure 3 compares the service provided by each technology in the three decarbonization scenarios and the reference scenario for aviation and

shipping. Other modes and totals for the full transportation sector are
shown in Supplementary Figs. 7 and 8. By design, the low scenario has
much more remaining oil-based service after 2050 than the medium
and high scenarios, particularly in international shipping and long-haul
aviation. Biofuels play a more prominent role in the medium scenario
than in the high scenario, especially for aviation, due to the less
aggressive deployment of hydrogen and electric technologies. Supplementary Fig. 9 shows how these differences in technology mix
translate into fuel use across the transportation sector; by 2030, nonfossil fuels comprise 19% of transportation fuel use in the high scenario, more than double their fraction in the same year in the low
scenario.

In comparison to the reference scenario, service from all modes is
substantially reduced in all three decarbonization scenarios. For most
modes, much of this reduction in service is due to the assumption of
lower demand for transportation services in the decarbonization scenarios (Supplementary Tables 5 and 6). However, for aviation and
shipping, the imposition of the carbon policy further suppresses service due to price elasticity effects. In the low transportation technology scenario, cumulative service provided by aviation and shipping
from 2020 to 2100 drops by 40% or more for each mode relative to the
reference scenario, with carbon price effects responsible for over half
of this decline for international and domestic shipping and short-haul
aviation. In that scenario, the difficulty of fuel switching leads to elevated carbon prices (Supplementary Fig. 10) and a reliance on demand
destruction to meet emissions mitigation targets. However, ambitious
deployment of advanced technologies enables higher rates of fuel
switching and partially mitigates these reductions in service, as service

scenarios than in the low scenario (on the order of 2–7% increases in
cumulative service over the century for aviation and international
shipping; see further discussion of these and other modes in the
Supplementary Notes: Additional Discussion of Shifting Patterns of
Transportation Service Across Scenarios). The shifting patterns of
transport service across scenarios highlight one of the tradeoffs
between different decarbonization pathways that emerge in our lowmedium-high scenario framework.
#### Impacts beyond the transportation sector

The differing levels of transportation decarbonization affect the
intensity of mitigation required in other sectors (Fig. 4). In the low
transportation technology scenario, the reduced level of ambition in
the transportation sector forces other sectors to substantially limit
their emissions to maintain the same economy-wide emissions constraint. Notably, industry reaches zero emissions by 2100 in that scenario (Fig. 4a, c). The medium and high scenarios allow for less

combustion turbines; for all other modes, hydrogen fuel cell electric vehicles are
modeled. Also note that there is a very small amount of coal-based freight rail
service that is not shown in the figure as it phases out by 2025 and provides only a
miniscule contribution to global freight rail transport in the preceding periods
(0.009 trillion ton-km of service in 2005, 0.007 trillion ton-km in 2010, and 0.002

demanding emissions mitigation outside of the transportation sector,
particularly in industry and buildings. Cumulative emissions differences between the high and low scenarios across the century are largest for industry (128 Gt CO 2 ) and electricity (74 Gt CO 2 ) (Fig. 4b,
Supplementary Tables 7 and 8). The additional flexibility in emissions
mitigation strategies also allows for increased output from industrial
sectors in the high transport ambition scenario. Similarly, less carbon
capture and storage (CCS) is required in industry in the high transport
technology scenario relative to in the low scenario, particularly in the
first half of the century (Fig. 4d). Carbon sequestration via bioenergy
with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) for both hydrogen and
electricity production is also reduced in both the medium and high
scenarios as compared to in the low scenario, though generation using
fossil fuels paired with CCS increases, likely due to the increased
emissions mitigation and elevated use of biofuels in transport. Across
the economy, the high transport technology scenario decreases total
carbon sequestration by 0.2–0.7 Gt CO 2 relative to the low scenario in
all periods from 2030 onwards.

Looking beyond emissions, the medium and high scenarios
increase demand for both hydrogen and alternative liquid fuels in the
transportation sector but lead to reduced use of these fuels in other
sectors (Fig. 5a, b). For hydrogen, higher transport demand is driven
especially by road vehicles and shipping (Supplementary Fig. 11). In the
high scenario, the transportation sector consumes more than 17 EJ of
hydrogen by 2050, or 69% of all hydrogen consumption, as compared
to 9.4 EJ (47%) in the medium scenario and 5.5 EJ (28%) in the low
scenario. The high scenario also increases economy-wide hydrogen
demand in 2050 by over 25% relative to the low scenario, though by
2100 the scenarios have nearly equalized. For the alternative liquid
fuels, from 2025 onwards, all FT biofuels and e-fuels produced are
consumed by aviation and shipping, with aviation using the majority
(Supplementary Table 9 and Supplementary Fig. 12). The increased
consumption of biofuels and e-fuels by transportation limits their
availability for other sectors, as the fraction of biofuels and e-fuels in
refined liquids consumed by non-transportation sectors is lower in the
medium and high scenarios than in the low scenario from 2030
onwards (Supplementary Table 10). The industrial sector, for example,
uses 11.5 EJ of biofuels and e-fuels in 2100 in the low scenario but only 8
EJ in the high scenario (Fig. 5b). Similar shifts occur between the

industrial and transport sectors in terms of their electricity consumption; in 2050, the transport sector consumes 14 EJ more electricity in the high scenario relative to in the low scenario (39 EJ vs 25 EJ,
respectively), while the industrial sector consumes 20 EJ less (Supplementary Fig. 13).
The different levels of ambition in the transport sector and their
associated fuel demands also have consequences for the upstream
generation of those fuels (Fig. 5c, d). In all three decarbonization
scenarios, 99% of electricity and 98% or more of hydrogen is produced using low carbon technologies by 2050. The high ambition
transport scenario requires increased electricity generation in early
periods relative to the low ambition scenario due to the rapid electrification of transportation modes, with most of this increased
generation initially supplied by fossil sources while renewable sources and CCS technologies are still scaling up (Fig. 5c). After midcentury, both the medium and high scenarios see less electricity
production than the low scenario, particularly via BECCS and solar
power. In hydrogen production, most of the elevated hydrogen
demand in the high transport technology scenario is met by
increased generation via electrolysis using grid electricity (Fig. 5d).
Hydrogen production using BECCS is notably reduced in the higher

in which economy-wide bioenergy use is subject to a stricter constraint, maximizing at 70 EJ in 2100, than in our standard 1.5 °C-consistent scenarios.

adjustment scenario. In the SSP2, SSP3, and SSP4 scenarios, passenger
transport service demand is higher than in the standard high scenario
primarily due to the larger global population in those scenarios, while
freight service demand is lower due to reduced global GDP (Fig. 6c and
Supplementary Fig. 14). In the SSP3 and SSP4 scenarios, the net effectis
an overall reduction in energy demands for transport across fuel types,
though to a lesser degree for hydrogen than for other fuels (Fig. 6d, e);
the elevated carbon prices in these scenarios (over 50% higher than in
the standard high scenario by late-century; see Supplementary Fig. 15)
increase the cost-competitiveness of hydrogen, particularly for international shipping. In the SSP2 scenario, total energy use by transport is
similar to the standard high scenario, but the fuel breakdown shifts:
biofuels are used less, replaced by hydrogen and, in later years, electricity (Fig. 6d, e). This likely results in part from a reduction in
purpose-grown biomass production in the SSP2 scenario due to land
use competition with crop production, as food demand and associated
land requirements increase with the larger SSP2 population (Supplementary Fig. 16). The SSP5 scenario sees higher transportation demand
and elevated use of all fuels, but the increase in e-fuel use (more than
triple in the standard high scenario by 2100) is especially notable. Efuels, particularly those produced via on-site hydrogen electrolysis
powered by wind energy, achieve their lowest costs in this scenario
(Supplementary Fig. 17). In the more constrained bioenergy sensitivity
case, transport biofuel consumption is 25% lower in 2100 than in the
standard high scenario, corresponding to a 3 EJ difference which is
mostly compensated for by elevated electricity and e-fuel consumption (Fig. 6d, e). Aside from the impacts of these differences in biofuel
and e-fuel use, the relative contributions of the advanced technologies
to the decarbonization of each transport mode are largely robust
across the standard high scenario and the sensitivity scenarios (Supplementary Figs. 18 and 19; see further discussion in the Supplementary Notes: Additional Discussion of Sensitivity Scenarios).
## Discussion

Aggressive technological development and an earlier fossil phase-out
in the transportation sector can substantially reduce carbon emissions
from transport, complementing the emissions cuts required in other
sectors. In our high transportation technology scenario, the transportation sector achieves zero direct carbon emissions by 2050. In
contrast, in the medium and low scenarios, residual transportation
emissions after 2050 must be offset by negative emissions in other
sectors or CO 2 removal technologies to achieve economy-wide net
zero emissions. We find particularly notable interactions between the
transportation and industrial sectors, in that when transportation
decarbonization ambition is low, ambition in industry must be high to
compensate, and when transportation ambition is high, industry has
more flexibility in emissions reductions strategies. We also observe
lower deployment of BECCS for both hydrogen and electricity production in our high ambition transport scenario, likely due to both
elevated use of biofuels by the transportation sector (in the context of
the economy-wide constraint on bioenergy) and the reduced need for
carbon sequestration in that scenario due to increased mitigation by
transport. Within the transportation sector, higher ambition also partially alleviates the reductions in aviation and shipping service due to
the stringent emissions constraint, allowing for more transport service
without compromising climate goals. Exploration of these inter- and
intra-sectoral dynamics is important when examining pathways for
achieving zero emissions, particularly when considering deep decarbonization across multiple sectors and the resulting implications for
alternative fuel demands and technology shifts.
Achieving such ambitious levels of transportation decarbonization will require technological transitions across the sector. We find
that electrification contributes most to this decarbonization, particularly for road and rail transport, consistent with other studies [4][,][13][,][15][,][23][,][30][,][32] .
Hydrogen and biofuels are also crucial for long-distance travel in


aviation and shipping. While we observe that the decarbonization of
long-haul aviation heavily depends on biofuel use, synthesis of biofuels
via the FT pathway will still require advanced research, development,
and commercialization to be used on the scale necessary to satisfy
aviation biofuel demand [48][,][57] . Given these challenges, as well as potential limitations on bioenergy use and the increasing investments in the
development of hydrogen propulsion systems for aviation by some
industry leaders [58], it is possible that hydrogen-based technologies
could outpace biofuels to provide a larger share of long-haul aviation
service than indicated by our results. In our primary scenarios, e-fuels
only see limited utilization due to their relatively high costs, supporting prior analyses [21][,][49][,][59] . However, we also observe that under high
economic growth (SSP5) assumptions and/or tightly constrained
economy-wide bioenergy availability, e-fuel deployment increases,
particularly for long-haul aviation. These results offer insights into the
conditions under which some industry pathways and other analyses
that rely on e-fuels for aviation decarbonization may be more likely to
be realized [13][,][60] . E-fuel subsidies or blending mandates may further
increase their utilization, which could reduce the need for other low
carbon transportation fuels but may lead to overall higher costs
associated with decarbonizing the sector. Other zero emissions fuels
that we do not model, most notably ammonia, are also being considered for aviation and shipping [19][,][61] ; additional integrated modeling
could analyze the potential role of these fuels in transportation decarbonization pathways and the resulting costs and benefits, taking into
consideration the potential implications of widespread ammonia use
on the nitrogen cycle [62] .
By identifying key low carbon technologies for each transportation mode, our results can help guide the development and prioritization of emerging technologies, facilitating the transition to a
1.5 °C-aligned future. Such information is crucial given the speed that is
required for this transition to be successful: even in the low transportation technology scenario, passenger transport service provided
by low carbon technologies triples between 2020 and 2030, and
freight service almost doubles. In the high scenario, service from
alternative technologies grows by eight times in passenger transport in
this ten-year period, and almost three times in freight.
Realizing this rapid scale-up of emerging technologies would pose
a variety of challenges for resource and fuel availability, infrastructure
development, and supply chain management. As electric and
hydrogen-based technologies for many modes, particularly aviation
and shipping, are still nascent, their utilization at the scale observed in
our high ambition scenario would depend on continued advancement
and successful market entry [2][,][12][,][13] . High levels of transport electrification
would necessitate the widespread deployment of charging infrastructure, for vehicles ranging from passenger cars to large cargo
ships, and produce a large demand for critical minerals for battery
development [10][,][31] . Similarly, ubiquitous transportation hydrogen use
would require the large-scale development of vehicle technologies, as
well as hydrogen transmission and distribution networks and/or onsite electrolysis systems at refueling stations [10][,][49] . To ensure that electric and hydrogen-based vehicles are truly zero emissions beyond the
tailpipe, the upstream production of these fuels must also
decarbonize [10][,][63][,][64] ; the transition from current fossil fuel-dominated
production would need to occur alongside an expansion in generating
capacity to meet rising electricity and hydrogen demand [13] . The production of biofuels for use by the transportation sector would also
need to scale up by almost 5 times relative to 2020 levels and shift
primarily to advanced generation technologies to meet aviation and
shipping biofuel demands of more than 13 EJ by 2050 in the high
ambition scenario. This biofuel production would have resulting consequences for land use and associated emissions that will depend on
the specific biofuel generation pathways that are most widely
employed [49][,][63][,][65][–][67] . Emerging technologies that co-produce multiple
forms of biofuels intended for use in different transportation modes or

other applications could also help address some of the tradeoffs in
biofuel usage that arise in our scenarios [25] . For all low carbon technologies, ensuring that sufficient financial capital and human resources

—
are available at all stages of the supply chain including procurement
of raw materials and resources, technology manufacturing and
deployment, and infrastructure siting and development—will be critical to avoid any bottlenecks that could constrain or impede the
massive scale-up required [31][,][68] .
Our results suggest that financial and policy incentives, including
mechanisms such as carbon prices, could be crucial to ensure the
competitiveness of low carbon technologies in transport. Future
research evaluating specific policies and incentive structures, as well as
quantifying the associated resource and development needs at each
stage of the supply chain, would complement our work and facilitate
the development of sectoral decarbonization plans. In our analysis, we
maintain the same assumptions for demand reduction, transit and
ride-sharing preference, and efficiency improvements in all our decarbonization scenarios. Building on both our work and other
studies [31][,][34][,][69] by considering alternative scenarios for these behavioral
changes and other consumer preferences could add another valuable
dimension to modeling of pathways for transport decarbonization. As
we observe substantial reductions in transport non-CO 2 emissions in
our high ambition scenario, additional studies could quantify the
benefits for air quality and health of an earlier elimination of fossil fuel
use in the sector [70] . Incorporating those benefits into an integrated
assessment of the distributional impacts of transportation decarbonization strategies would complement our findings, enabling a
robust consideration of economic, environmental, and equity implications of technological transitions in the transportation sector.
## Methods

We use GCAM version 6.0, with all scenarios run on the Pacific
Northwest National Laboratory’s high performance computing cluster,
deception. GCAM’s assumptions for conventional, fossil fuel-based
transportation technologies are documented in Mishra et al. [71] .
Assumptions for advanced, low carbon transportation technologies
have been updated with recent model development and are available
in the GCAM documentation [72] . As maritime shipping and aviation are a
focus of our work, we also include information on the non-fuel costs
and energy intensities assumed for these modes in the Supplementary
Methods (Shipping and Aviation Technology Assumptions section),
particularly detailing the assumptions employed for shipping and
aviation low carbon technologies. Aside from the scenario assumptions and new modeling capacity discussed below, all other technological and socioeconomic parameters match those in the core release
of GCAM version 6.0 [73] .

GCAM includes a hybrid, or high efficiency, technology option for
refined liquids-based transportation technologies, facilitating the
endogenous representation of efficiency improvements. As this is not
a focus of our work, however, in our results we aggregate the high
efficiency liquids technologies with their corresponding standard
efficiency counterparts when showing transportation service by technology. GCAM also includes walking and cycling modes, which we do
not feature in our results as they contribute relatively small shares of
total passenger transport and do not demand any energy.
We added the capability to model synthetic hydrocarbon fuels
using carbon captured from the atmosphere via direct air capture
(DAC) and hydrogen as prospective drop-in replacements for today’s
petroleum-derived liquid fuels. We parameterized four technologies
for synthetic fuels production, which differ in how both the required
electricity and hydrogen are produced. This is intended to represent
varying degrees of stringency regarding the use of fossil fuels to generate the electricity and/or produce the hydrogen and allow each of
these technologies to compete on a cost basis. The first technology
uses grid electricity to capture CO 2 from the atmosphere and


purchases an industrial hydrogen commodity which may either be
produced on-site or delivered via pipeline or liquid truck from a centralized hydrogen production facility. The second technology uses
grid electricity to capture CO 2 from the atmosphere and electrolyze
hydrogen on-site. The last two technologies use electricity generated
by dedicated wind turbines or solar panels, respectively, to run both
the DAC and hydrogen electrolysis processes and are intended to
represent the most restrictive definition for zero-carbon hydrogen and
electricity sourcing. The levelized capital and fixed operating costs for
the hydrogen electrolyzers and DAC equipment for these technologies
are adjusted using regionally explicit capacity factors for wind turbines
and solar panels and are harmonized with GCAM’s electricity
sector [74][,][75] . Parametric assumptions for hydrogen production and distribution are provided in the GCAM 6.0 release [73] . The DAC cost and
energy performance parameters assume a high-temperature, fullyelectric liquid solvent-based process most similar to the one being
developed by Carbon Engineering, as this is, to our knowledge, the
most detailed publicly-available cost and performance data for a
commercial DAC to liquid fuels process [76] . The derivation of GCAM
input assumptions for this process is documented in Fuhrman et al. [77] .
The energy and non-fuel cost coefficients for DAC are multiplied by
19.6 kg C per GJ of fuel, consistent with GCAM’s existing refined liquids
commodity, and 1.19 GJ of hydrogen is assumed to be required per GJ
of liquid fuels produced [78] . Efforts to evaluate alternative sources of
captured CO 2, including waste CO 2 and low-temperature DAC processes in GCAM are the subject of separate studies. We do not consider
ammonia as a potential zero carbon fuel due to the large uncertainty
regarding fugitive emissions that could further disrupt planetary
boundaries for reactive nitrogen and fully negate any climate benefit
achieved by avoiding CO 2 emissions [62] . Efforts to model DAC-tomethanol as a means of decarbonizing the petrochemical sector are
also left as an area for future work, as this technology is not considered
in this study.
In our cost calculations, we use the DAC costs shown in Supplementary Table 1 to calculate costs that would be required to offset
residual post-2050 transportation emissions with DAC. These costs are
derived from GCAM assumptions for DAC non-energy costs and
energy coefficients, as well as endogenously calculated GCAM energy
costs, and are linearly interpolated between the years shown in Supplementary Table 1. In calculating the break-even carbon prices for
electric and hydrogen-based shipping and aviation technologies
(Supplementary Table 4), we compute the difference in costs (on a
per service output basis) between the low carbon technologies and the
corresponding standard refined liquids-based technology, divided by
their difference in emissions per service output. We only consider
direct emissions in this calculation; thus, electric and hydrogen-based
technologies are assumed to generate zero emissions. Cost values are
used from the reference scenario and include both energy and non
energy costs.
#### Emissions constraint

In our 1.5 °C scenarios, we impose a carbon emissions constraint that
limits global warming to below 1.5 °C in 2100. This constraint applies to
fossil fuel and industry carbon emissions and begins in 2025, GCAM’s
first timestep beyond the present. Carbon emissions from land use are
excluded from the constraint but are priced at an increasing fraction of
the carbon price applied to fossil emissions; this encourages carbon
storage through land use change, but only as an addition to the
mandated emissions reductions from fossil fuel and industry sources.
Non-CO 2 greenhouse gas emissions are also not constrained, but their
forcing impacts are incorporated in GCAM’s temperature projections.
For comparisons with scenarios in the IPCC AR6 database, we
select 1.5 °C scenarios using their FaIRv1.6.2 category (C1a, C1b, and C2:
below 1.5 °C with no, low, or high overshoot, respectively). We select
reference scenarios using their policy category name (P1a: Baseline). In

calculating CO 2 -equivalent emissions from non-CO 2 greenhouse gases
for our scenarios, we use global warming potentials from the AR5
report; we compare these values to the emissions of Kyoto gases from
scenarios in the IPCC AR6 database. We compare the temperature
projections for our scenarios generated by Hector, the reduced form
carbon-cycle climate model linked to GCAM, to the 50th percentile
FaIRv1.6.2 surface temperature variable for the AR6 scenarios.
#### Scenario assumptions

To vary the level of technological ambition between our 1.5 °C scenarios, we adjust the rates at which electric and hydrogen-based
transportation technologies phase in and fossil-based technologies
phase out. For aviation and shipping, the elimination of fossil fuels
occurs through the alternative liquid fuel blending mandates shown in
Supplementary Fig. 20, representing the minimum fraction of liquid
fuels for use in aviation and shipping that must be supplied by e-fuels
or FT biofuels in each year. For road and rail transportation, liquid fuel
use is completely discontinued by 2100 in the medium ambition scenario and by 2050 in the high ambition scenario. In the low ambition
scenario, we impose no blending mandate for aviation and shipping
nor a phase-out of fossil fuel use in the transportation sector.
In all the primary 1.5 °C scenarios, we assume lessened demand for
transportation services as well as more ridesharing and public transportation use. We implement these assumptions by reducing the
income elasticities for transportation (as shown in Table 2), increasing
the load factors for 4-wheel light duty vehicles linearly so that a 25%
improvement is achieved in 2050, and using the SSP1 assumptions for
value of time traveled to encourage use of public transport.


We also implement a variety of assumptions consistent with sustainable development pathways outside of the transportation sector to
ensure that our scenario design incorporates comparable levels of
increased mitigation across all sectors. These assumptions include
reduced population growth, increased energy and material efficiency
in the buildings and industrial sectors, reduced demand for industrial
goods and services, faster transition to renewable electricity sources,
dietary preference changes leading to lessened consumption of animal
products and non-staples, constraints on overall bioenergy production, and achievement of the reduction in HFC emissions established
by the Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol. Most shifts match
those in the 1.5 °C “sectoral strengthening” scenario from Fuhrman
et al. [44], as shown in Table 3.
Our sensitivity scenarios are implemented as modifications of our
standard 1.5 °C high transportation technology scenario; except as
specified in the following, all input parameters match those in the
standard 1.5 °C high scenario. In the 1.5 °C high: income elasticity
adjustment scenario, we use GCAM’s default income elasticity values,
shown in Table 2, rather than the reduced income elasticity values
employed in all other 1.5 °C-consistent scenarios. In the 1.5 °C high:
price elasticity adjustment scenario, we reduce the price elasticity for
transportation by 20% from the default value in GCAM. In the SSP
sensitivity scenarios, we employ population and GDP trajectories
consistent with each of the respective SSPs (Supplementary Fig. 14).
SSP3 and SSP5 place high pressure on the global economic, energy,
and climate systems due to their rapid growth in population (SSP3) or
GDP (SSP5). To ensure the feasibility of achieving the 1.5 °C-consistent
emissions constraint in those scenarios, we increase their respective

negative emissions budgets (i.e., the maximum allowed gross value of
negative emissions, as a percent of GDP) by 50% above their default
values in GCAM. In the low bioenergy sensitivity scenario, we further
limit economy-wide bioenergy availability beyond the constraint
implemented in the other 1.5 °C-consistent scenarios; bioenergy use
maximizes at 70 EJ in 2100 in this sensitivity case, as compared to 100
EJ in the standard 1.5 °C high transport technology scenario.
