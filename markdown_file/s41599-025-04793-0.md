# Carbon market and emission reduction: evidence from evolutionary game and machine learning
### Keyang Zhan [1] & Zhengning Pu [2] [✉]

The carbon market is a key tool for China to meet its emission reduction targets, but it is still

in the early stages of development. More evidence is needed to assess its effectiveness in

reducing carbon emissions. This paper establishes an evolutionary game model to analyze the

interaction between the government and enterprises and applies the Gradient Boosting

Decision Tree (GBDT) algorithm to identify carbon emission reduction effects of the carbon

market based on carbon emission data from 2000 to 2019. The theoretical model reveals

that the construction of China’s carbon market needs to go through three stages: stages of

lack of enthusiasm from both the government and enterprises, government dominance, and

market dominance. The empirical results show that the carbon market has a significant

carbon emission reduction effect, which affects regional carbon emissions through techno
logical innovation, fiscal, and digitalization effects. Further analysis indicates that the maturity

of the carbon market and the readjustment of industrial structure contribute to carbon

emission reduction effects. Although carbon emission reduction effects are not achieved by

reducing labor employment, a resource curse effect may still emerge. This study deepens the

understanding of China’s carbon market construction and offers valuable insights for policy

practices aimed at high-quality development.

Introduction

ith the acceleration of industrialization, the carbon
emissions generated by human activities have been

W continuously increasing, causing serious impacts on

the global climate system (Nordhaus, 2019). The Global Climate
Status 2023 report (The World Meteorological Organization
(WMO) released on March 19, 2024) indicates that the global
near-surface average temperature in 2023 is 1.45 ± 0.12 °C higher
than the average value from 1850 to 1900, making it the hottest
year in the 174-year observational record. Climate events such as
rising sea levels, ocean heatwaves, and melting ice caps, caused by
global warming, further encroach upon human living space,
urging countries to actively seek more energy-efficient, low-carbon, and green development models (Hansen et al., 2012; Zeng
et al., 2024). As the world’s largest developing country and the
largest emitter of carbon (Yang et al., 2021), China’s attitude
towards carbon emissions is of great significance to global
environmental governance. China attaches great importance to
environmental issues and actively promotes economic structural
transformation through various means, achieving simultaneous
economic efficiency and green development. China’s attitude and
determination towards carbon reduction lay the foundation for
the construction of the carbon reduction framework.
Since the 21st century, China has begun to explore new ways to
combine market and regulation. Through the establishment of a
sound environmental protection legal system, China has gradually increased the attention of enterprises to environmental protection and has made great achievements. Since 2013, Beijing and
other provinces and cities have carried out pilot carbon markets
and gradually expanded the coverage of carbon markets. Up to
now, a nationwide carbon market system framework has been
initially established. However, it must be admitted that compared
to carbon markets in regions such as the EU, New Zealand, and
California (USA), China’s national carbon market does face issues
such as its late establishment, immature development, and
imperfect trading systems. Transitioning from pilot local carbon
markets to a national carbon market will encounter new problems. Blindly including emission control entities in the carbon
trading scope not only increases government governance pressure
but also hinders the long-term growth of enterprises. While
regional carbon market pilots have achieved limited success,
controversies surrounding carbon markets persist (Bushnell et al.,
2013), particularly in areas such as employment (Liu et al., 2017)
and technological innovation (Weber and Neuhoff, 2010; Ren
et al., 2020). This study seeks to provide evidence to address these
debates and effectively demonstrate the efficacy of carbon markets in environmental governance. A carbon market-driven
mechanism and a government-led administrative mechanism
play complementary roles in China’s carbon reduction efforts
(Ellerman, 2005). If carbon emission reduction effects of carbon
markets are proven effective in China, critical questions arise:
How should China structure its carbon reduction framework?
Can this approach to carbon reduction be distilled into actionable
lessons? Current research has yet to fully resolve these controversies regarding carbon markets or systematically summarize
China’s phased approaches and experiences in carbon reduction
through theoretical models.
To bridge this gap, this study conducts a comprehensive analysis of carbon markets from both theoretical and empirical
perspectives. On the theoretical front, this study introduces the
evolutionary game theory to carbon market research, establishing
a government-enterprises evolutionary game model (Hofbauer
and Sigmund, 1998; Nowak, 2006). It provides an in-depth analysis of the interactions between the government and enterprises
during the construction of the carbon market. The findings reveal
that China’s carbon market development progresses through


three stages: a stage where both government and enterprises show
low enthusiasm, a stage dominated by government intervention,
and a stage where market mechanisms take precedence. These
theoretical insights offer robust support for the construction of
the carbon market. On the empirical front, the study employs
machine learning algorithms to identify carbon emission reduction effects and analyzes the core mechanisms and heterogeneous
influencing factors of the carbon market. The empirical analysis
seeks to provide reliable evidence to address ongoing debates
surrounding the construction of the carbon market.
Overall, this study revisits the carbon market from the perspective of game theory and provides empirical evidence for its
effectiveness. The innovations and potential contributions of this
study span three areas: theory, method, and results. Firstly, this
study analyzes the interactions between government and enterprises within the evolutionary game framework, offering insights
into their behaviors during carbon market construction. By
employing evolutionary game theory, it highlights the critical role
of government in the initial stages of carbon market development.
Innovatively, this study proposes that China’s carbon market
construction must undergo three phases: lack of enthusiasm from
both the government and enterprises, government-led development, and market-led growth, which holds significant implications for the advancement of the national carbon market.
Secondly, this study applies machine learning algorithms to
identify carbon emission reduction effects, providing robust evidence for the effectiveness of the carbon market. Unlike existing
studies, which primarily assess carbon market policies using linear frameworks, this study employs the Gradient Boosting
Decision Tree (GBDT) algorithm to evaluate the carbon market
in China. The identification results further confirm the effectiveness of carbon emission reduction effects. Additionally, they
introduce a novel methodological approach to evaluating carbon
markets, providing a solid foundation for exploring the relationships between carbon markets and other influencing factors.
Thirdly, the research enhances the understanding of China’s
carbon market and its role in achieving carbon reduction goals.
The results reveal the technological innovation effect, fiscal effect,
and digitalization effect. The technological innovation effect and
digitalization effect are closely aligned with the goal of highquality enterprise development. Meanwhile, the fiscal effect
highlights the important role of the government in the construction of the carbon market. This study also emphasizes that
improving market development levels and promoting industrial
structure optimization can enhance the effectiveness of the carbon market. Furthermore, it examines the welfare effects of the
carbon market on employment and the “resource curse” in
environmental regulation, shedding light on the mechanisms
underlying the resource curse in this context. These findings hold
significant value for deepening policymakers’ understanding of
carbon markets and their strategic implications.
The remaining structure is arranged as follows: The second
part is literature review; the third part is key facts, theoretical
analysis and research hypotheses; the fourth part is model and
data; the fifth part is empirical results and robustness tests; the
sixth part is mechanism tests and heterogeneity tests; the
seventh part is discussion; the eighth part is conclusion and
recommendation.

Literature review
As climate and environmental challenges grow increasingly
severe, carbon markets and carbon reduction measures have
garnered significant attention in academic research (Sandoff and
Schaad, 2009). From a global perspective, both administrative

approaches, represented by carbon taxes, and market-based
mechanisms, exemplified by carbon markets, are being implemented in various countries, including the United States. China
has also begun to explore related environmental regulatory strategies. Early research primarily focused on government-led
environmental regulations. However, with the emergence of
policy lag effects and political uncertainties, studies on marketbased tools have increased significantly. Specifically, research on
China’s carbon market mainly includes three directions: environmental effects, economic effects, and the combination of
administrative and market-based emission reduction systems.
Although existing studies can generally be divided into these
three directions, there is still controversy surrounding carbon
market research, and many issues have yet to reach a unified
conclusion.

The first stream of literature on carbon markets focuses on
environmental effects. Existing research has mainly concentrated
on the impact of carbon markets on carbon emission reductions
(some literature also discusses the impact of carbon markets on
other pollutants. Because such studies are not directly related to
the focus of this paper, they are not elaborated upon here). The
general view is that the market mechanisms established by carbon
markets may have positive effects on green technological innovation (Li et al., 2018; Xu and Cui, 2020; Hu et al., 2020), green
productivity (Yang et al., 2021), and internal corporate decisionmaking (Zhang and Wang, 2021), thereby significantly reducing
regional carbon emissions. For example, Zhang et al. (2017),
analyzing panel data from 30 Chinese provinces between 2000
and 2013, found that carbon markets significantly reduce regional
carbon emissions, and underdeveloped carbon markets may
possess greater potential in the future. It is important to note that
existing literature does not reach a unified view on the environmental effects of carbon markets. On one hand, the existence of
carbon markets has led to carbon emission spillover effects,
specifically in the form of inter-regional spillovers (Gao et al.,
2020) and inter-industry spillovers (Zhou et al., 2020). On the
other hand, there is controversy regarding the mechanism
through which the environmental effects of carbon markets
operate. For instance, regarding green innovation as a mechanism, Xu and Cui (2020) argue that carbon market policies significantly promote corporate technological innovation, while
Yang et al. (2016) and Chen et al. (2021) hold opposing views.
Therefore, it is necessary to provide more evidence of the effectiveness of carbon markets. To address this challenge, this study
uses machine learning to identify the carbon reduction effects of
carbon markets and analyzes the underlying mechanisms in
detail.

The second stream of literature on carbon markets focuses on
economic effects. The traditional view holds that, while keeping
total revenue unchanged, diverting some resources to environmental governance will inevitably crowd out economic development. As a result, some scholars have attempted to discuss the
crowding-out effects of carbon markets on economic activities
and raised questions about the construction of carbon markets
from an economic perspective. Zhang et al. (2013), through an
analysis of factors influencing carbon emissions, observe that
stringent carbon reduction targets reduce provincial welfare
effects by approximately 20%. Zhang et al. (2019) argue that while
market mechanisms achieve carbon reduction by curbing economic output, they also sacrifice economic development opportunities in pilot regions. However, Porter et al. (1995) firmly
believe that well-designed environmental regulations can enhance
corporate competitiveness, thus achieving a win-win situation for
both the environment and the economy. Influenced by this perspective, Liu et al. (2016) report that the establishment of a carbon market in Hubei Province reduced carbon emissions by 6.98


million tons while only slightly affecting economic output, with
GDP decreasing by just 0.06%. It is clear that evaluating the
effectiveness of carbon markets from the perspective of their
economic effects is also crucial. This study takes employment as
an entry point to discuss whether carbon markets lead to
crowding-out effects on employment. The results show that
carbon markets do not crowd out labor employment, thus providing support for the effectiveness of China’s carbon market
design.
The third stream of literature on carbon markets focuses on
China’s carbon emission reduction system, which combines
administrative measures with market-based mechanisms. A key
feature of China’s carbon reduction approach is the integration of
administrative and market-based tools. Past environmental governance studies have shown that well-designed administrative
measures have unique advantages in promoting carbon reduction
(Li and An, 2012). However, excessive administrative intervention can distort corporate activities due to high institutional costs
(Fu et al., 2017). On the other hand, market mechanisms like
carbon markets can regulate pollution levels through pricing,
significantly reducing hidden costs. This has become one of the
key arguments supporting the development of carbon markets
(Shi and Li, 2020). Therefore, combining administrative and
market mechanisms has become an important strategy in constructing China’s carbon market (Yi et al., 2018). Wu et al. (2021)
is one of the classic papers discussing the effectiveness of China’s
carbon market. Building on Melitz (2003), Wu et al. (2021)
analyzed the impact of carbon markets on carbon emissions and
examined the synergistic effects of administrative and market
mechanisms. The topic of this paper is similar to that of Wu et al.
(2021), but there are significant differences: Firstly, Wu et al.
(2021) analyzed the effectiveness of carbon market construction
but did not summarize the experiences of building China’s carbon
market. This is insufficient for fully understanding China’s carbon market. This paper summarizes the development process of
China’s carbon market through an evolutionary game model and
considers the role of factors such as digital transformation. Secondly, Wu et al. (2021) provide limited discussion on the
mechanisms behind carbon reduction effects. While Wu et al.
(2021) discussed carbon markets within a general equilibrium
framework, they neglected the mechanism analysis between carbon markets and carbon emissions. This leads to a somewhat
fragmented logic in their analysis. In contrast, this paper provides
a detailed discussion of the mechanisms to address the gaps in
existing research.
Additionally, from a methodological perspective, many studies
suffer from overly strict assumptions that fail to align with economic realities. Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE)
models (Fischer and Springborn, 2011; Dissou and Karnizova,
2016), general equilibrium models (Tang et al., 2015), and auction
models (Tang et al., 2017) are widely employed in research on
carbon markets. However, most of these models assume that
economic agents exhibit perfect rationality, which imposes
excessively stringent requirements on real-world economic
agents. In contrast, the evolutionary game approach moves
beyond the traditional framework of perfect rationality by
incorporating bounded rationality and the learning abilities of
economic agents into mathematical models (Weibull, 1997). This
approach better aligns theoretical models with economic realities,
providing a more realistic representation of agent behavior in
carbon markets.
Overall, although the practical issues surrounding China’s
carbon market have received ongoing attention, certain research
gaps remain. On one hand, existing studies exhibit significant
controversies regarding this topic, particularly in terms of the
unclear effectiveness of the carbon market and the ambiguity of

its impact mechanisms. On the other hand, these studies have not
effectively addressed how to balance the relationship between the
government and the market or provided a clear delineation of
their respective roles in the carbon reduction process. A likely
reason for these gaps is the overly stringent assumptions in
existing theoretical models. To address these shortcomings, this
study develops an evolutionary game model to better analyze the
relationship between the government and the market in the
process of carbon reduction. Furthermore, it identifies the effectiveness of the carbon market, providing additional theoretical
evidence to support its development.

Theoretical framework and research hypotheses
Key facts. The first key fact is about China’s carbon emission
pattern. According to data from the International Energy
Administration (EIA), China’s energy consumption per unit of
GDP was 3.4 tons of standard coal in 2019, which is 1.5 times the
global average and significantly higher than that of major
developed countries. Additionally, based on data from the Global
Carbon Monitor in 2020, China emitted 9,894,000,000 tons of
carbon, ranking 1st in the world. In comparison, Europe and
North America emit 1,659,000,000 tons and 1,123,000,000 tons,
respectively. China’s carbon emissions far exceed other regions,
accounting for 32.31% of the world’s total emissions. From a
global perspective, China’s carbon emissions are characterized by
high intensity and large total volume. Since surpassing the USA in
carbon emissions in 2006, China has experienced a brief decline
in 2016 and 2017 but overall has continued to rise, reaching
11,470,000,000 tons in 2021. A significant factor contributing to
China’s carbon emissions is its high dependence on fossil energy.
Data from the National Bureau of Statistics shows that China’s
foreign oil dependency in 2019 reached 72%, coal imports in 2019
amounted to 265,000,000 tons, and sectors highly dependent on
fossil energy such as power generation, transportation, construction, and energy production and transformation contribute
over 90% of the country’s carbon emissions. There are also significant differences in carbon emissions among different industries. High energy-consuming sectors such as energy production
and transformation, steel, building materials, and chemicals
account for 47%, 17%, 9%, 8%, and 7% of energy-related carbon
emissions respectively. China is in a stage of high-quality transformation, with the value added by the secondary industry still
accounting for 37.8% of GDP and employing 225,000,000 people.
This indicates that reducing dependence on the secondary
industry in the short term is challenging. These characteristics
show that China’s carbon emissions are not yet in a plateau phase,
there is significant heterogeneity in carbon emissions across
industries, and the comprehensive difficulty of carbon emission
management at China’s current stage of development is high.
The second key fact is about the carbon market and carbon
emissions. The establishment of a carbon market has a significant
impact on carbon emission reduction effects, aligning well with
China’s practical needs for carbon reduction (Li et al., 2023).
According to externality theory and property rights theory,
carbon emissions have negative externalities, and a market
lacking defined property rights and with high transaction costs
cannot correct the polluting behavior of economic entities. The
emergence of the carbon market clarifies the property rights
issues related to corporate carbon emissions and significantly
reduces the costs associated with carbon trading. China’s attempts
to establish a carbon market can be divided into two stages. From
2005 to 2012, China participates in the EU’s carbon trading
market through the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). By
learning from the EU’s carbon market practices, China’s carbon
emission intensity decreased by 20% in 2012 compared to 2005,


and the share of renewable energy in primary energy consumption increased by 1%. Additionally, the government expands its
role in environmental protection, investing over 835,000,000,000
RMB to promote carbon reduction actions and approving more
than 3000 CDM projects. After 2012, China initiates carbon
emissions trading pilots in various regions (Goulder et al., 2022),
including Beijing (Nov., 2013), Guangdong (Dec., 2013), Hubei
(Apr., 2014), Shanghai (Dec., 2013), Tianjin (Dec., 2013) and
Chongqing (Jun., 2014), to explore a carbon market with Chinese
characteristics. By 2019, China’s carbon emission intensity had
decreased by 45.8% compared to 2005, and the share of non-fossil
energy in total energy consumption had significantly increased to
14.3%, achieving a carbon reduction of 5,260,000,000 tons. In
2021, the cumulative trading volume of allowances in local
carbon markets will reach 480,000,000 tons of CO2 equivalent,
with a transaction value of approximately 11,400,000,000 RMB.
These pilot carbon markets provide valuable experience for the
establishment of a national carbon market. The national carbon
market is officially launched in 2021, developing in synergy with
local carbon markets. As of 2023, the average transaction price in
local carbon markets reaches 113.3 RMB per ton, and new
mechanisms, such as green electricity trading and energy use
rights trading, are introduced. The national carbon market’s
carbon price increased by 23% compared to 2022, with trading
volumes about four times that of 2022. The allowance trading
volume for the second compliance period reaches 212,000,000
tons. The achievements of China in both local and national

carbon markets further advance the carbon market as a core
means to achieve the 30·60 targets.

Theoretical analysis. Yao et al. (2022) argue that the public tends
to have a more negative attitude toward carbon reduction, primarily due to the unclear effectiveness of related policies.
Therefore, accurately assessing the effectiveness of related policies
becomes particularly important. This paper conducts a detailed
analysis using an evolutionary game model. The reasons for
choosing the evolutionary game model are as follows: On the one
hand, the evolutionary game model can analyze the changes in
individual behavior over time. The construction of China’s carbon market is a long-term and ongoing process. Therefore, it is
especially important to analyze in detail the strategic changes and
stability of the government and enterprises over time. On the
other hand, the evolutionary game model emphasizes the evolution and adjustment of historical experience. This paper assumes
that the players are not fully rational and can optimize their
decisions based on the past game process. This assumption is
more closely aligned with real-world situations and satisfies the
assumptions of the evolutionary game model. In considering the
carbon reduction model of the carbon market, the government
and enterprises are the core interest entities, each aiming to
maximize their own benefits. During the game process, the
information between the government and enterprises is not
completely symmetrical, and both entities operate with bounded
rationality. They gradually adjust their strategies based on predictions of each other’s strategies, ultimately arriving at a set of
strategies acceptable to both parties. Therefore, this paper establishes an evolutionary game model between the government and
enterprises to analyze the construction of China’s carbon market.

Basic assumptions. This paper sets up an evolutionary game
model including the government and enterprises, and makes the
following assumptions in the model:
Assumption 1: The government can choose between an Active
Promotion (of Carbon Market) strategy ðX 1 Þ and a Passive
Promotion (of Carbon Market) strategy ðX 2 Þ for participating in

carbon reduction. The government’s strategy set is S 1 ¼
�X 1 ; X 2 �: The probability of adopting X 1 is x, and the probability
of adopting X 2 is 1 � x, with 0 < x < 1. The government is a
boundedly rational agent with learning capabilities, able to choose
and implement behavioral plans.
Assumption 2: Enterprises can choose between an Active
Participation (in Carbon Market) strategy ðY 1 Þ and a Passive
Participation (in Carbon Market) strategy ðY 2 Þ. The strategy set of
the enterprises is denoted as S 2 ¼ fY 1 ; Y 2 g. The probability of
enterprises adopting Y 1 is y, and the probability of adopting Y 2 is
1 � y, with0 < y < 1.
Assumption 3: When enterprises adopt different strategies,
they face different profits. To simplify the model, let the profit
of a passively participating enterprise be R. Enterprises mainly
participate in carbon reduction by digital transformation, and
using green technologies to upgrade products (Yang et al.,
2023). Through green technology innovation, enterprises
upgrade their products, gaining a green innovation efficiency
i, making their profit ð1 þ iÞR. The cost of innovation due to
green technology is C. Digital transformation further creates
opportunities for enterprise development, represented by the
digital enablement efficiency ω, thus the actual profit for an
actively participating enterprise is ð1 þ ωÞð1 þ iÞR. Correspondingly, digital transformation also introduces more risks, with
the risk cost rate denoted by λ.
Assumption 4: The government’s active promotion of
enterprises towards green and low-carbon development can be
achieved through transformation subsidies (TS), environmental
awareness cultivation (EEC), and administrative penalties (AP,
mainly in the form of carbon taxes). Specifically, TS includes
incentives for green technology innovation (IGTI) and incentives
for digital transformation (IDT). The cost of IGTI is U, and the
intensity by which the government executes IGTI is represented
by τ. For simplicity, it is assumed that the costs for IDT are
linearly related to those for IGTI. The cost of EEC is I, and the
intensity by which government executes EEC is represented by ϕ.
The cost of AP is O, and the intensity by which government
executes AP is represented by ρ. In addition, if enterprises timely
integrate into the carbon market and achieve low-carbon
development, the government will gain additional benefits R e .
(additional benefits include environmental effects, public satisfaction, etc.) Otherwise, the government will incur additional losses
C e . (additional costs incurred for environmental remediation,
decreased public trust due to ineffective government policy
formulation and supervision, etc).
Assumption 5: The construction of the carbon market changes
the cost-benefit relationship between the government and
enterprises (a more detailed explanation of this hypothesis can
be found in the Appendix).

Payoff matrix. In the evolutionary game model, both the government and the enterprises are rational participants with
bounded rationality, and they select strategies according to their
own preferences. Before constructing the payoff matrix, this
paper summarizes the benefits of the government and the
enterprises. The government’s benefits include income obtained
through penalizing enterprises, additional revenue and losses,
actual costs of TS, and actual costs of EEC. The benefits of the
enterprises include revenue obtained through production and
market behavior, subsidies and incentives from the government,
and the costs faced by the enterprises in transformation.
Based on the above assumptions and the strategic choices, the
payoff matrix of game benefits can be constructed for different
scenarios of strategic choices. There are four combinations of



game strategies for the government and enterprises: ðX 1 ; Y 1 Þ,
ðX 1 ; Y 2 Þ, ðX 2 ; Y 1 Þ and ðX 2 ; Y 2 Þ. The specific payoff matrix is
shown in Table 1.

Equilibrium analysis of the model. Based on the above assumptions, this paper calculates the expected payoffs for X 1 and X 2,
which is denoted as E x and E 1�x respectively. Using the expected
payoffs, the expected payoff for government (E x ) is calculated as
follows:

E x ¼ y R� e � �1 þ φ�τU � ϕI� þ ð1 � yÞðρO � ϕI � C e Þ

þ R e y � τUxy � φτUxy

Based on Eq. (1) to Eq. (3), the replicator dynamic equation
(Proof of the replicator dynamic equation for the government can
be found in the Appendix) for the government can be derived as
follows:

Similarly, this paper calculates the expected payoffs for Y 1 and
Y 2, which is denoted as E y and E 1�y respectively. The expected
payoff for enterprises (E [�] y ) is calculated as follows:

E y ¼ x 1�ð þ ωÞ 1ð þ iÞR þ 1� þ φ�τU � ð1 þ λÞC� þ 1ð � xÞ½ð1 þ ωÞð1 þ iÞR �ð1 þ λÞC�

According to Eq. (5) to Eq. (7), the replicator dynamic
equation for enterprises (The proof of the replicator dynamic
equation for enterprises is detailed in the Appendix) can be
derived as follows:

Proposition 4: τ positively affects the tendency of enterprises
to choose Y 1 . That is, the tendency of enterprises to choose Y 1
increases as τ increases, and vice versa.
Proposition 5: φ positively affects the tendency of enterprises
to choose Y 1 . That is, the tendency of enterprises to choose Y 1
increases as φ increases, and vice versa.
It is evident that ESS is related to several parameters, such as ρ, O,
ϕ and so on (Specific judgments on ESS can be found in the
Appendix). Therefore, based on the impact of carbon market
construction on the interests of the government and enterprises, this
paper discusses how changes in enterprise revenue and costs affect
the stable strategies in evolutionary games under the conditions of
ρO < ϕI and 0 < ρOþρ ð 1O�þϕφI Þ [τ][U] [<][ 1. (Based on the assumption, there]

Specifically, we divide the discussion into the following three
scenarios (When ðω þ i þ ωiÞR > ð1 þ λÞC, it may be impossible to determine the situation of

this paper does not discuss the scenario where
ðω þ i þ ωiÞR > ð1 þ λÞC):

F xð Þ � 0 or GðyÞ � 0. If y ≠ y [�], x [�] ¼ 0 and x [�] ¼ 1 are the two
evolutionarily stable strategies (ESS) for the government. Thus,
when y > y [�], F xð Þ ¼ 0 leads to x [�] ¼ 0, meaning x [�] ¼ 0 is ESS for
the government. When y<y [�], F xð Þ ¼ 0 leads to x [�] ¼ 1, meaning
x [�] ¼ 1 is ESS for the government. Similarly, if x ≠ x [�], y [�] ¼ 0 and
y [�] ¼ 1 are ESS for the enterprise. When x > x [�], y [�] ¼ 0 is ESS for
the enterprises. When x<x [�], y [�] ¼ 1 is ESS for the enterprise.

Therefore, when λ increases, we obtain y < y [�] and the stable point

we propose Proposition 1:
Proposition 1: λ inversely affects the tendency of enterprises to
choose Y 1 . That is, the tendency of enterprises to choose Y 1
increases as λ decreases, and vice versa.
Similarly, a simple analysis leads to the following Propositions
(detailed analysis can be found in the Appendix):
Proposition 2: i positively affects the tendency of enterprises to
choose Y 1 . That is, the tendency of enterprises to choose Y 1
increases as i increases, and vice versa.
Proposition 3: ω positively affects the tendency of enterprises
to choose Y 1 . That is, the tendency of enterprises to choose Y 1
increases as ω increases, and vice versa.

stable strategy. Thus, ðX 1 ; Y 2 Þ is ESS when the transformation
cost is much higher than the profit from green products.
Based on the analysis above, we propose Proposition 6:
Proposition 6: The ultimate strategy choices of the government and enterprises depend on the relative cost-benefit of the
enterprise in the process of transformation.
According to the assumptions, the establishment of the carbon
market has profound implications for both the government and
enterprises. Before the establishment of the carbon market, the
relative changes in the cost-benefit of government and enterprise
led to ESS discussed in Scenario 3. At this point, neither
government nor enterprises show enthusiasm for promoting the
construction of the carbon market. With the initial attempts of the
carbon market, the government begins to demand actions from
enterprises and fosters environmental awareness among them.
However, according to the perspective of the Life Cycle Theory, the
gap between the costs and benefits of enterprise transformation still
hinders their proactive engagement. Therefore, the initial attempts
of the carbon market lead to ESS discussed in Scenario 6. At this
point, the construction of the carbon market is government-led.
Further development of the carbon market aligns the institutional
system, legal system, industrial system, innovation system, and
other supporting measures with the low-carbon development of
enterprises, significantly reducing the costs of enterprise transformation. Consequently, the continuous improvement of the carbon
market leads to ESS discussed in Scenario 4. At this point, the
construction of the carbon market is market-led.

The above results indicate that China’s carbon reduction
model needs to go through three stages: the stage of lack of
enthusiasm from both the government and enterprises, the
stage of government dominance, and the stage of market
dominance. In summary, we outline the development path of
China’s carbon reduction model based on the evolutionary
game model. This paper provides new theoretical evidence for
carbon market policies to stimulate enterprises to reduce
carbon emissions.

Simulation. This paper uses MATLAB R2023b to conduct simulation and emulation of the evolutionary game model, demonstrating the evolutionary trajectory of interactions between the
government and enterprises, as well as the strategic choices of each
entity. Moreover, the sensitivity analysis of some parameters
(Numerical simulation details are provided in the Appendix) is also
conducted. The results of the numerical simulation show that the
strategic choices of either the government or the enterprise will
affect the strategic choices of the other entities. Rational incentives
and penalties from the government can effectively stimulate the
transformation and development of enterprises, while the relative
changes in interests and costs during the transformation process are
crucial determinants for enterprises to adopt certain strategies. The
simulation results further confirm the above analysis and propositions, providing strong support for the government-led to marketled carbon market construction model.

Research hypotheses. The above theoretical analysis indicates
that in the process of achieving China’s carbon reduction goals,
carbon market policies and the construction of a carbon market
are important channels that cannot be ignored. Fully considering
the impact and mechanism of carbon market policies and the
construction of a carbon market on China’s carbon reduction
status is a basic prerequisite for building a nationwide carbon
market. Through the model, it is reasonable to infer that the
carbon market has a significant impact on carbon emission
reduction through technological innovation effect, fiscal effect,
and digital effect. In order to verify this view, we put forward the


core hypothesis of this paper based on the theoretical model. In
addition, this paper also discusses the mechanism and other
factors in further research. Therefore, this paper proposes the
following hypothesis:
Hypothesis: Carbon market policies and pilot carbon
markets have a significant inhibitory effect on China’s carbon
emissions.

Model and data
Identification strategy. To estimate the real impact of carbon
emission reduction effects, this paper needs to predict the
counterfactual of carbon emissions in areas without the influence

of carbon markets. The difference between the actual carbon
emissions and the counterfactual reflects, to some extent, the
impact of carbon emission reduction effects. This paper chooses
the GBDT algorithm in machine learning to predict the counterfactual level of carbon emissions (Friedman, 2001). The reasons for choosing the GBDT algorithm are as follows: Firstly, the
GBDT algorithm has high prediction accuracy (Freund and
Schapire, 1997). The GBDT algorithm uses the method of gradient boosting to continuously add new decision trees to the
model to achieve optimization. In each round of iteration, the
GBDT algorithm decides the selection of the next decision
tree based on the error of the previous model, gradually reducing
the model’s residual to improve prediction accuracy. Secondly,
the GBDT algorithm has good robustness to outliers and noise
(Friedman, 2001). The GBDT algorithm uses multiple decision
trees for learning, and each decision tree contributes to the final
prediction result, reducing the problem of overfitting. Thirdly, the
GBDT algorithm has good predictive ability for nonlinear relationships. Existing research usually assumes linear relationships
between carbon emissions and factors such as economic development and policy changes (Naegele and Zaklan, 2019), and then
uses linear models to estimate the effects of related factors.
However, the trend of carbon emissions in reality is often complex and may exhibit nonlinear changes. Therefore, using the
GBDT algorithm to predict changes in carbon emissions has its
unique advantages. In contrast, linear models are susceptible to
the influence of outliers and have limited ability to identify
nonlinear relationships. In addition, the GBDT algorithm can
effectively handle high-dimensional data. In the process of
identifying the effects of the carbon market, multiple variables
and their interactions are involved. These variables may have
complex interactions. Traditional regression models struggle to
capture such complex relationships, whereas the GBDT algorithm
enhances identification capability by constructing multi-level
decision trees. This paper sets up model Eq. (10) and Eq. (11).
The model trained using Eq. (10) (Although the purpose of this
paper is to examine the impact of carbon emissions on the three
industrial sectors from the perspective of carbon market policies
and carbon market construction, in order to ensure that the
model’s predictive ability is not compromised due to insufficient
training data, this paper refines the data to the industry level to
increase the number of training samples) obtains a model with
good predictive ability. Using the model shown in Eq. (11) for
prediction, the parameters in the model remain consistent with
Eq. (10), thereby maintaining good predictive ability. The specific
model setup is as follows:

where t, i and k represent time, industry, and sector, respectively.
Carbon represents carbon emissions. Following the approach of
Guo et al. (2022), this paper introduces lag terms in Eq. (10) and
Eq. (11) to enhance the predictive ability of the model. In addition, following the studies of Lin and Liu (2010), Lu and Qiu
(2013), and Liu (2023), this paper selects Popu, Dev, InteTrad and
Ener as other control variables. Popu, Dev, InteTrad and Ener
respectively represent population factors, development factors,
international trade factors and energy consumption factors. The
specific details of the model are as follows: Common hyperparameters in GBDT include the number of iterations, the depth
of the gradient boosting trees, the minimum number of samples
required for a node split, and the learning rate. These hyperparameters significantly influence the model’s performance. The
number of iterations determines the model’s learning capacity:
while a higher number of iterations can improve the model’s
fitting ability, it also increases the risk of overfitting. The number
of iterations typically ranges from 100 to 1000. Higher iteration
counts can enhance the model’s predictive ability by allowing it to
fit the training data more effectively, but this also increases the
computational cost and training time. The maximum depth of the
gradient boosting trees controls model complexity. A shallower
depth helps prevent overfitting. The maximum depth of gradientboosting trees is generally set between 3 and 10. Shallower depths
are preferred in many cases to prevent overfitting, as they restrict
the model’s complexity and ensure it generalizes well to unseen
data. A lower minimum number of samples for node splitting
allows the model to be more flexible in fitting the training data.
The learning rate determines the contribution of each gradientboosting tree to the final prediction. The learning rate is often
chosen within the range of 0.01 to 0.1, with common values being
0.01, 0.05, or 0.1. A lower learning rate reduces the contribution
of each individual tree to the final model, requiring more iterations to converge but improving the model’s generalization capability. This trade-off between the learning rate and a number of
iterations allows for finer adjustments in fitting the data without
sacrificing robustness. During hyperparameter selection, it is
essential to balance the need for optimizing model performance
with the risks of overfitting. Based on the meaning of these
hyperparameters, specific settings were chosen: the number of
iterations, maximum depth of the gradient boosting trees, minimum number of samples for splitting, and learning rate were set
to 1000, 4, 2, and 0.01, respectively. To mitigate potential overfitting risks, a relatively low learning rate was selected to reduce
the model’s sensitivity to noise and enhance its generalization
capability. The chosen maximum tree depth helps to avoid
overfitting while ensuring the model captures essential nonlinear
relationships, which is an empirically optimal choice for most
datasets. For large datasets, the minimum number of samples for
splitting is typically sufficient to prevent overfitting. Additionally,
it is worth noting that parameter settings were re-evaluated
during robustness checks to ensure the reliability of the identification results. Data partitioning is crucial for model performance.
Considering various factors, the training and test sets are divided
in 9:1. The reasons are as follows: Firstly, using 90% of the data


for training ensures there is enough data for learning, which
guarantees the model’s accuracy. Secondly, this approach, as a
well-validated empirical choice, helps balance the training and
testing effectiveness of the model. It is important to note that this
study also recognizes that data partitioning can impact the
model’s performance. Therefore, the model is re-partitioned
during robustness checks to ensure the reliability of the results.

Data and variables. The data selected in this study mainly come
from the CEADs, the National Bureau of Statistics of China, and
CSMAR. Among them, carbon emission data mainly come from
CEADs, while population factors, development factors, international trade factors and energy consumption factors mainly come
from the National Bureau of Statistics of China. Some incomplete
data in the National Bureau of Statistics of China are supplemented by data from CSMAR. Missing values and some extreme
values in the dataset were cleaned, resulting in a training set of
11,040 data points.
Lin and Liu (2010) used Monte Carlo simulation to point out
that GDP growth and energy intensity are important factors
affecting China’s carbon emissions. Lu (2013) further pointed out
that the spillover effects of international trade in technology and
other fields also affect carbon emissions. Liu (2023) added
population and other factors when predicting carbon emission
trends. Following the practices of relevant literature, this paper
introduces relevant variables into the model. The explanation of
the relevant variables is as follows: (1) Carbon emissions:
Specifically, it refers to the carbon emissions of industries,
sourced from CEADs. (2) Population variables: Specifically, it
refers to the number of employees at the end of the year in a
certain industry, sourced from the National Bureau of Statistics of
China. (3) Development factors: Specifically, it refers to the actual
regional gross domestic product calculated at constant prices in
1999, sourced from the National Bureau of Statistics of China. (4)
International trade factors: Specifically, it refers to the total
import and export volume of the region. (5) Energy consumption
factors: Specifically, it refers to the total energy consumption of
the industry, sourced from the National Bureau of Statistics of
China, with some data supplemented by CSMAR. Further
descriptions of relevant data are presented in Table 2.

Empirical results. To assess the effectiveness of carbon market
policies, this paper identifies carbon emission reduction effects.
Firstly, based on the actual situation of carbon markets in various
provinces and cities from 2000 to 2013, this paper trains the
model shown in Eq. (10). The MSE of the model is 0.0178. R [2] for
the training set is 0.997, and R [2] for the test set is 0.916. MSE is a
common metric for assessing the prediction error of regression
models. It calculates the average of the squared differences
between predicted and actual values. The smaller the MSE, the
stronger the model’s predictive ability. Specifically, the value of
0.0178 indicates that the average error between the model’s predictions and the actual data is 0.0178, which means the model is
very accurate in most predictions, with small errors. R² measures

the extent to which the independent variables explain the variation in the dependent variable. In the training set, an R² of 0.997
indicates that the model almost perfectly fits the training data,
explaining 99.7% of the data’s variation. This shows excellent
prediction performance on the training set. R² of the test set is
0.916, meaning that the model can still explain 91.6% of the
variation in unseen test data. Combining the above analysis, it is
found that the GBDT model has strong fitting ability on the
training set and maintains good generalization ability on the test
set. Additionally, the low MSE indicates that the model’s error in
predictions is small. Therefore, these parameters suggest that the
model performs well in this task, being able to accurately learn
the patterns in the data while handling unseen data effectively.
Secondly, taking the year 2014 as the policy shock point, this
paper uses data from pilot areas to examine the effects of carbon
market policies. By introducing the relevant data of policy pilot
areas into the model and obtaining corresponding predicted
values, the predicted values at this time can be regarded as the
carbon emissions that exist if the pilot areas have not been subject
to policy shocks. Figure 1 and Fig. 2 provide graphical evidence
for the effectiveness of carbon market policies by showing the
trend of carbon emissions in pilot provinces and various industries. From left to right, Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, respectively, represent
the changes in carbon emissions in the primary, secondary, and
tertiary industries. From top to bottom, Fig. 1, respectively,
represents the effects of carbon market policies in Beijing,

Guangdong, and Hubei, while Fig. 2, respectively, represents the
effects of carbon market policies in Shanghai, Tianjin, and
Chongqing. The meanings of the lines in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 are as
follows: the blue solid line represents the actual carbon emissions
from 2000 to 2019. The red dashed line represents the transition
from the actual carbon emissions in 2013 to the predicted carbon
emissions in 2014, used to better represent the trend of changes.
The red solid line represents the predicted carbon emissions from
2014 to 2019. The results in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 show that the
predicted carbon emissions from 2014 to 2019 are mostly higher
than the actual carbon emissions from 2014 to 2019. This indicates that if the pilot areas are affected by policy shocks and
carbon market construction, their actual carbon emissions are
higher. Therefore, it can be largely assumed that carbon market
policies have a significant effect on actual carbon emission
reductions in pilot areas. To further examine whether there are
differences between predicted values and actual values, this paper
conducts an inter-group mean difference test on the two sets of
data. Unlike the results shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, this paper
conducts more detailed examinations from the perspective of the
overall carbon market pilot areas, individual pilot areas, and the
three industries of the pilot areas. As shown in Table 3, the
carbon emission reduction effects of carbon market construction
are significant from the perspective of the overall carbon market
pilot areas. carbon emission reduction effects of the three
industries are also significant. Although there are some areas

where the overall effect of carbon market construction is not
obvious from the perspective of individual pilot areas (the reason
for the insignificant overall carbon emission effect of the carbon
market in Guangdong Province is that the carbon emissions from
the manufacturing industry in Guangdong Province account for a
relatively high proportion of the overall emissions. The lag in
carbon market construction and the reliance of Guangdong
Province on the secondary industry are important factors leading
to the poor carbon emission reduction effect of the carbon market
in the secondary industry of Guangdong Province) (e.g.,
Guangdong), the construction of carbon markets also has a significant effect on the carbon emissions of their industries from
the perspective of sub-industries. Therefore, policy shocks and the
construction of carbon markets have a restraining effect on carbon emissions in pilot areas, greatly improving the carbon
emissions situation in these areas.

Robustness tests. To ensure the robustness of the benchmark
results, this paper conducts the following robustness tests:

Resetting the model. In order to ensure the robustness of the
model, we adjust the division of the training set and test set of the
model, the model parameters and so on. We find that the re-set
model still shows that the carbon market has a carbon emission


reduction effect, which is consistent with the benchmark regression results. It further proves that the benchmark regression
results are robust.

The identification of other provinces. To ensure that the model in
the identification strategy does not have systematic bias, this
paper uses the trained deep learning model to make predictions
for other provinces. Excluding provinces in the western region
with relatively low carbon emissions, this paper selects Hebei,
Henan, Hunan, and other provinces in the central and eastern
regions with relatively high carbon emissions for predictions. The
inter-group differences between the actual values and the predicted values are reported in Table 4. The results show that
carbon reduction after the carbon emission policy point does not
show a significant decline for other provinces with high carbon
emissions. Therefore, this result indicates that the model’s predictions do not have a systematic bias to a certain extent, and the
identification strategy is credible.

Establish a linear model to re-estimate carbon emission reduction
effects of the carbon market. To further enhance the robustness of
the identification strategy, this paper attempts to re-examine the
policy effects using other policy evaluation methods. If the results
of these tests are consistent with the previous findings, it further
validates the credibility of the identification strategy. Due to the

nature of machine learning algorithms, there is no need to impose
restrictions on the parallel trend assumption when identifying
policy effects in this paper. Within the existing economic research
paradigm, evaluating policy effects under the difference-indifferences (DID) framework is a common approach in academia, which imposes strict requirements on the parallel trend
assumption. Therefore, this paper strictly controls for the parallel
trend assumption and uses a linear estimation method to identify
policy effects. Following the approach of Lu et al. (2021) and Ma
et al. (2022), a classical DID model is set up to conduct robustness
checks on the policy effects of the carbon market. The specific
model is shown in Eq. (12):

lnCarbon ntk ¼ β 0 þ β 1 did ntk þ β 2 treat ntk þ β 3 post ntk
ð17Þ
þβ 4 control ntk þ δ n þ γ t þ η k þ ε ntk

where n represents the province. lnCarbon is carbon emissions,
with the variable being log-transformed to reduce endogeneity
issues. did is the core explanatory variable, representing the
interaction term between treat and post. The construction
method of DID is as follows: did ¼ treat ´ post. treat ntk indicates
whether it is a treatment group. The value of treat is determined
as follows: when n represents Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai,
Guangdong, Chongqing, or Hubei, treat ¼ 1. Otherwise,
treat ¼ 0. post ntk indicates the policy implementation time. The
value of post is determined as follows: when t ≥ 2014, post ¼ 1.
Otherwise, post ¼ 0. control represents the control variables
affecting carbon emissions. δ n, γ t and η k represent time fixed
effect, province fixed effect, and industry fixed effect, respectively,
controlling for factors affecting regions that change with the time,
province, and industry. ε ntk denotes the error term. To avoid
potential heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation issues, this paper
clusters the standard errors at the province-industry level. The
meanings of the other variables are consistent with those in Eq.
(10) and Eq. (11).
The test results are shown in Table 5. After introducing control
variables as well as time fixed effect, province fixed effect, and



industry fixed effect, the results indicate that the coefficient of did is
significantly negative at the 5% level ðdid; 4ð Þ; r ¼ �0:293; p<0:05Þ,
further confirming the negative impact of the carbon market on
carbon emissions. Additionally, since the DID model has strict
assumptions regarding time trends, this paper also conducts a
parallel trend test and a placebo test. The robustness test results
passed both the parallel trend test and the placebo test (This paper
conducts parallel trend tests and placebo tests for the DID model,
and the results are all passed. Due to space limitations, the detailed
analysis is placed in the Appendix).

Excluding the impact of other policies. Since 2007, the Ministry of
Finance of China, along with several other departments, has
launched pilot programs for paid use and trading of emission
rights in 11 provinces and cities, including Jiangsu and Zhejiang.
The implementation of this policy has interfered with the evaluation of the carbon market policy. Therefore, this paper
excludes the provinces and cities that conducted the emission

rights trading pilot to re-evaluate the effect of the carbon market
policy. As shown in Table 6, the results remain significant
ðdid; 1ð Þ; r ¼ �0:356; p<0:01Þ.

Excluding certain samples. Due to the late initiation of Fujian’s
carbon market (Fujian’s carbon market is launched in December
2016, significantly later than other carbon markets), its presence
may interfere with policy evaluation. To eliminate this interference, this paper adopts two approaches: Firstly, this paper
excludes Fujian Province from the sample. Secondly, this paper
excludes data from 2017. The results, as shown in Column (2)
and Column (3) of Table 6, are consistent with the identification
strategy results.

Eliminating minor timing differences. There are slight time differences among various carbon markets. To further minimize the
impact of these timing differences, this paper uses a multipleperiod DID approach for re-estimation. The results, as shown in
Column (4) of Table 6, are consistent with the identification
strategy results, and this consistency has also passed the parallel
trend test and placebo test (The analysis of the multi-period DID
is detailed in the Appendix).

Double/debiased machine learning (DDML). In this study, double/
debiased machine learning is applied to re-identify the core conclusions, and we find that the results remain consistent with the
core conclusions (The specific process is detailed in the Appendix).

Further research

Mechanism tests. The construction of the carbon market can
impact carbon emissions reduction through mechanisms. To
further examine mechanisms by which the carbon market affects
carbon emissions reduction, this paper adopts the method of the
mediation effect model to test the relevant mechanisms. The
commonly used mediation effect model is the three-step mediation effect model proposed by Wen and Ye (2014). However, this
method often faces serious biases. Specifically, it frequently
encounters severe endogeneity issues when applied to economic
research. Psychology research requires mainly experimental data,
which can significantly reduce endogeneity between data through
methods like random experiments. In contrast, economic
research requires mainly observational data, making it difficult to
accurately determine causal relationships. Therefore, drawing on
Jiang (2022) perspective, this paper incorporates Eq. (13) into Eq.
(12) to design a two-step mediation effect model for testing the


influencing mechanism. Equation (13) is as follows:

Mediator ntk ¼ β 0 þ β 1 did ntk þ β 2 treat ntk þ β 3 post ntk
ð18Þ
þβ 4 control ntk þ δ n þ γ t þ η k þ ε ntk

Among them, Mediator is the mediating variable and its
specific definition will be introduced separately in the following
text (three issues need to be noted: firstly, the issue of endogeneity
between mediating variables. In selecting the variables, this paper
deliberately avoids this problem. Whether from the data sources
or the relationships between the variables, the endogeneity
between the variables is low. Local fiscal environmental protection expenditure is primarily determined by the government
based on central policy guidelines, local environmental governance needs, and fiscal budgets. Its decision-making process is
more based on environmental quality objectives and policy
guidance, rather than being directly driven by the number of
green patent applications or grants. The decision to apply for
green patents by enterprises is mainly driven by research and
development capabilities and policy incentives, rather than being
entirely dependent on changes in digitalization levels. Local fiscal
environmental protection expenditure and regional digitalization
levels are respectively driven by government fiscal decisions and
market forces, with limited interaction between the two. Secondly,
the issue of endogeneity due to reverse causality is low. This is
mainly due to the exogeneity of the carbon market pilot policy
and the differences in policy objectives and dependent variables.
Thirdly, to avoid the influence of other factors, this paper
introduces control variables to mitigate the effect of observable
variables and introduces fixed effects to mitigate the impact of
unobservable variables). Other variables are consistent with Eq.
(10) and Eq. (11). Equation (13) is used to test the influence of the
carbon market on the mediating variable.

Technological innovation effect. According to Proposition 2, there
is a close relationship between carbon market policies, green
technological innovation, and carbon emissions reduction. The
construction of carbon markets enhances the technological
innovation capabilities of enterprises. Enterprises utilize technological innovation to control carbon emissions and improve the
level of product greenization, thereby reducing carbon emissions.
Based on command-and-control measures and market incentive
measures, the construction of China’s carbon market significantly
stimulates the technological innovation capabilities of enterprises
(Fan and Sun, 2020). Command-and-control measures have
heterogeneous effects on enterprises of different scales (Tao et al.,
2021). For large enterprises with sufficient funds, a certain technological innovation foundation and a relatively complete production chain targeting energy conservation and emission
reduction can prompt enterprises to carry out technological
transformation along the industrial chain. They can use pollution
control equipment to reduce pollution at the end of production.
This approach can even achieve comprehensive industrial chain
upgrades across industries and regions. Small enterprises lacking
large-scale technological innovation capabilities and foundations
choose to concentrate resources such as funds and labor into the
green upgrade of their advantageous products. In areas lacking
competitive advantages and development potential, they choose
to shut down. Market incentive measures increase enterprise
production costs through market and economic means, forcing
enterprises to achieve Polluter Autonomy. These measures
indirectly drive enterprises to strengthen the greenization of
production materials, processes, and products through technological innovation aimed at carbon emissions reduction goals
(Wang, 2016). Therefore, the construction of carbon markets
utilizes mandatory and incentive measures to boost enterprise

technological innovation capabilities, promote the use of technological innovation to upgrade the production process of products, and thereby achieve the carbon reduction goals of
enterprises.
Following the approach of Wang and Wang (2021), this paper
utilizes the number of green patents as the mediator variable. Due
to the time difference between patent application and patent
utilization, using only the number of green patent applications to
measure the effect of technological innovation may result in bias.
Therefore, this paper manually screened the number of green
patent applications ðGreenPat1Þ and the number of green patent
grants ðGreenPat2Þ from 2000 to 2019, comprehensively
measuring the effect of technological innovation. The regression
results are shown in Column (1) and Column (2) of Table 7. The
results indicate that the construction of the carbon market
significantly promotes the number of green patent
applicationsðdid; 1ð Þ; r ¼ 2:011; p<0:1Þ and the number of green
patent grants ðdid; 2ð Þ; r ¼ 0:952; p<0:1Þ, enhancing the local
green technological innovation capability. This result suggests
that the construction of the carbon market can reduce the carbon
emissions of local industries by enhancing the green technological
innovation of regional industries.

Fiscal effect. The construction of carbon markets has heightened the local government’s inclination towards environmental protection, empowering them to actively promote
regional carbon emission reduction effects. Environmental
regulatory policies, represented by carbon markets, have relied
heavily on local government promotion in the early stages of
implementation (Yuan et al., 2022). Policies such as the
emissions trading pilot in 2007 and the 12th Five-Year Plan for
the Prevention and Control of Air Pollution in Key Regions in
2012 (Miao et al., 2021) have exhibited this characteristic
during implementation. The construction of carbon markets
and the goals of carbon reduction require local governments to
prioritize green development and expand fiscal support for
environmental protection. They also need to establish centralized financial, industrial, trading, and legal systems compatible with the development of carbon markets, facilitating
the construction of local carbon markets and the achievement
of carbon reduction goals (Zhan and Liu, 2020). Due to the
high public and spillover effects of green and environmental
industries, they may not be the optimal choice for economic
agents. At this point, local governments need to increase fiscal
expenditure, invest more in developing green and environmental industries that align with local development characteristics to meet local carbon reduction needs. Furthermore,


local government environmental regulatory tools are crucial
drivers for local enterprises to transform and develop green
industries (Li and Xiao, 2020). When facing low liquidity and
high financing constraints, the survival of local enterprises is
often their primary concern. Local governments can provide
financial support to enterprises through environmental subsidies and require them to internalize environmental costs,
thus enhancing product competitiveness and reducing enterprise carbon emissions. It can be seen that the fiscal effects of
local governments influence the policy effectiveness of carbon
markets.
This study selects local fiscal environmental protection
expenditure (LFEEP) as the mediating variable. According to
data from the National Bureau of Statistics, there were a large
number of missing values in regional fiscal environmental
protection expenditure before 2007, so the data for 2007 were
excluded from the regression. The estimation results of Eq. (12)
and Eq. (13) are shown in Column (3) and Column (4) of Table
7. The results indicate that the construction of carbon markets
has a significant inhibitory effect on carbon emissions
ðdid; 3ð Þ; r ¼ �0:238; p<0:05Þ. Additionally, the construction of
carbon markets significantly promotes environmental protection
expenditure ðdid; 4ð Þ; r ¼ 0:321; p<0:1Þ, thereby facilitating local
fiscal support for carbon reduction in local industries. The results
suggest that the fiscal effect plays a mediating role in the process
of how carbon market construction affects carbon emissions
reduction in regional industries.

Digitalization effect. From Proposition 3, it can be concluded
that digital transformation is one of the important means of
carbon reduction. The construction of the carbon market has
raised higher requirements for enterprise production. Traditional production methods cannot simultaneously meet the
goals of efficient and green development. Digital transformation of enterprises through management empowerment,
investment empowerment, operational empowerment, and
labor empowerment, has improved productivity and reduced
carbon emissions (Huang et al., 2023). Digital transformation
creates new opportunities for the development of agriculture,
manufacturing, and service industries (Huang and Wang, 2022;
Dai and Yang, 2022; Zhan and Pu, 2024). The construction of
the carbon market brings more constraints to enterprise
development, indirectly stimulating enterprises to seize the
opportunity of digital transformation to achieve high-quality
development. Digital transformation facilitates enterprise
financing by accurately matching data through information
processing methods and precisely assessing enterprise risks.

This reduces financing constraints caused by information
asymmetry and financial discrimination, providing a financial
foundation for enterprise green industry upgrading and technological transformation, and thus achieving enterprise carbon
reduction. Enterprise digital transformation enhances the
ability of enterprise resource allocation and energy utilization
efficiency, thereby promoting further decarbonization of
enterprises (Wei, 2022).
This study focuses on the characteristics of China’s digital
transformation, selecting the degree of digitization ðDIGIÞ from
2011 to 2019. Digital technology empowers industrial development and significantly promotes regional carbon reduction.
Referring to the data from Guo et al. (2020), this study
differentiates the relationship between digital inclusive finance
and the degree of digitization, selecting the sub-index of the
degree of digitization from Peking University’s digital inclusive
finance index to measure the digitalization effect. The estimation
results of Eq. (12) and Eq. (13) are shown in Column (5) and
Column (6) of Table 7. The results indicate that the construction
of the carbon market can significantly reduce the level of carbon
emission ðdid; 5ð Þ; r ¼ �0:238; p<0:05Þ, and the construction of
the carbon market significantly improves the regional degree of
digitization ðdid; 6ð Þ; r ¼ 8:301; p<0:05Þ. Therefore, the construction of the carbon market reduces carbon emissions by
increasing the degree of digitization, and the digitalization effect
serves as an intermediary in the process of the carbon market
construction affecting the carbon reduction of regional
industries.

Labor effect. The construction of the carbon market may have
asymmetric impacts on labor employment and the labor market
by influencing the reduction of carbon emissions in regional
industries. Environmental regulations represented by the carbon market have both substitution and complementary effects
on labor (Berman and Bui, 2001). The impact of carbon market
construction on labor ultimately depends on the relative size of
the substitution effect and complementary effect. On the one
hand, carbon market construction has a substitution effect on
labor employment. The construction of China’s carbon market
combines market mechanisms with administrative intervention
(Shi and Li, 2020). In addition to bearing the costs of information search under market mechanisms, enterprises also bear
the costs brought by administrative intervention (During the
process of constructing the carbon market in China, there is
strict administrative intervention, and enterprises need to bear
explicit costs (such as carbon taxes) and implicit costs (policy
impact costs) in the development process). Enterprises passively face rising production costs, leading them to reduce the
proportion of labor and labor investment, thereby passively
reducing carbon emissions in regional industries. Under the
influence of the voluntary carbon reduction goals advocated by
the carbon market and social responsibility objectives, enterprises, represented by labor-intensive industries actively reduce
labor employment. This, in turn, actively reduces carbon
emissions in regional industries. On the other hand, carbon
market construction has a complementary effect on labor
employment. The goal of carbon market construction requires
comprehensive carbon emission reduction throughout regional
industries (Hu et al., 2023). Some enterprises focus on environmental governance in the front and middle stages, providing
more employment opportunities and creating employment
effects while promoting labor employment, thus achieving
carbon emission reduction in regional industries (Wang and
Dong, 2020). Some enterprises focus on environmental governance in the backend, increasing the demand for environmental governance professionals and high-skilled labor. This



approach achieves multiple goals of industrial emission
reduction and increased employment in the region. When the
substitution effect of carbon market construction on labor
exceeds the complementary effect, carbon market construction
reduces carbon emissions in regional industries by reducing the
demand for labor by enterprises.
This paper manually collected data on labor conditions from
various provincial statistical yearbooks, selecting unemployment rate ðUnemploymentÞ, absolute employment ðLabor AbsÞ,
and relative employment ðLabor RelÞ as intermediate variables
to examine the impact of carbon market policies on labor. It is
worth noting that this paper selects the proportion of end-ofyear employment in various industries to the total employment
and takes the logarithm to characterize the relative employment. The estimation results of Eq. (12) and Eq. (13) are shown
in Column (1) to Column (4) of Table 8. The results indicate
that when different intermediate variables are selected, the
construction of the carbon market does not significantly
increase the unemployment rate ðdid; 2ð Þ; r ¼ 0:030; p>0:1Þ,
nor does it significantly bring about labor substitution
ðdid; 3ð Þ; r ¼ �11:101; p>0:1; did; 3ð Þ; r ¼ �0:096; p>0:1Þ.
Therefore, the construction of the carbon market does not
mechanistically affect regional industrial carbon emissions by
reducing enterprise labor demand, and the labor substitution
effect does not play an intermediary role in the process of
affecting regional industrial carbon reduction. A reasonable
explanation for this result is that Chinese enterprises emphasize
environmental pollution control throughout the entire industrial chain process, and measures such as industrial transformation, upgrading, and green technology governance create
more job opportunities for labor and generate higher demand
for labor.

Heterogeneity tests. This paper conducts relevant heterogeneity
tests on market maturity, industrial structure and resource
endowment (This paper also conducts relevant tests on financial
constraints, but does not find the impact of carbon market on
financial constraints).

Market maturity. Carbon trading is an important carbon emission
reduction method in low-carbon pilot areas. The carbon market,
as the foundation of carbon trading, naturally has a significant
impact on low-carbon regions. What balance between the construction of the carbon market and administrative intervention

measures can achieve better regional carbon emission reduction?
In order to examine the impact of the development level of carbon
markets in pilot areas on carbon emission reduction, this paper
introduces the interaction term of did and Market in Eq. (12),
denoted as didMarket. (It should be noted that this study does not
include the market scale Market in the model, for the following
reasons: When did ¼ 0, did ´ Market ¼ Market ¼ 0. When
did ≠ 0, did ´ Market ¼ Market) The construction method of
did Market is as follows: did Market ¼ did ´ Market. This paper
uses this variable to explore the impact of carbon market development on carbon emissions. Following the approach of Yu and
Liu (2020) and making appropriate improvements, this paper uses
the relative market trading scale to indicate the level of market
maturity. Specifically, it measures market maturity as the proportion of annual trading volume to the total carbon emissions in
the region. Due to data availability and the timing of carbon
market construction, this paper can only obtain the relative
market trading scale since 2014. As shown in Column (1) of
Appendix Table 5, the regression results indicate that the coefficient of did Market is significantly negative at the 10% level
ðdid Market; 1ð Þ; r ¼ �3:863; p<0:1Þ, which means that the
market maturity of the carbon market significantly promotes the
policy effect of the carbon market.

Industrial structure. Carbon market encourage enterprises to
achieve efficient and green development through industrial
upgrading and value chain upgrading (Liu et al., 2016). By
transitioning to a service-oriented approach, enterprises gradually abandon high-emission and high-pollution processes,
striving to improve product efficiency and service quality. The
service-oriented approach of enterprises promotes their
development towards high precision and sophistication at the
micro level. It fosters the development of the regional service
industry and adjusts the industrial structure at the meso level.
At the macro level, it contributes to green and high-quality
economic development. Following the approach of Yang and
Jiang (2021), this paper characterizes the industrial structure
ðIndStrÞ using the proportion of the value added by the tertiary
industry in the regional GDP. In Eq. (12), both IndStr and
did IndStr are introduced, with did IndStr constructed as
did IndStr ¼ did ´ IndStr. The regression results in Column
(2) of Appendix Table 5 indicate that the coefficient of
did IndStr is significantly negative at the 5% level
ðdid IndStr; 2ð Þ; r ¼ �0:012; p<0:05Þ, suggesting that the process of enterprise service-oriented transformation can effectively enhance the policy effectiveness of the carbon market
and promote low-carbon development of enterprises.

Resource endowment. Regional carbon emissions are also constrained by resource endowment (Zhang, 2008). To examine the
impact of resource endowment, the sample is divided into two
groups based on differences in resource endowment: resource
abundance and resource-scarcity. The regression results in Column (4) of Appendix Table 5 show that carbon markets have a
significant inhibitory effect on carbon emissions in resourcescarcity areasðdid; 4ð Þ; r ¼ �0:297; p<0:05Þ, but they do not have
a significant inhibitory effect on carbon emissions in resourceabundance areasðdid; 3ð Þ; r ¼ 0:091; p>0:1Þ. The empirical
p-values indicate that the policy effects differ significantly from
zero at the 5% level in both groups, resource- abundance and
resource- scarcity. This result further confirms the resource curse
effect in the field of environmental regulation (Lu, 2009). Due to
their high dependence on the energy industry, resourceabundance regions find it difficult for carbon market policies
and construction to bring significant carbon reduction effects in
the short term.


Discussion
The research findings effectively address the underlying hypotheses of this study. On one hand, this study hypothesizes that the
environmental impact of carbon markets is subject to debate.
Numerous studies have questioned the economic effectiveness of
carbon market development (Bryant, 2019). Conversely, many
others have affirmed the achievements of carbon markets in
environmental governance and technological innovation (Hernandez-Cortes & Meng, 2023). Building on this contested discourse, this study conducts an in-depth analysis of the
environmental effects of carbon markets. By employing machine
learning and other identification methods, it successfully identifies the actual impact of carbon markets on China’s carbon
emission reduction, thereby providing a theoretical foundation
for the country’s carbon reduction efforts. The findings also
confirm the hypothesis that China’s carbon market exerts a
positive environmental effect. Compared to existing studies, this
study presents the following innovations: Firstly, this study
addresses the controversy surrounding the effectiveness of carbon
markets. It argues that carbon markets have a significant impact
on carbon reduction. This conclusion differs from the perspectives of Zhang et al. (2013) and Zhang et al. (2019), who suggest
that carbon markets may hinder economic development due to
costs, unemployment, and other factors. Our findings confirm
that the effectiveness of carbon markets does not come at the
expense of employment. At the same time, our results support the
validity of carbon markets in achieving carbon reduction. Secondly, this study analyzes the mechanisms through which carbon
markets exert their influence. Although previous research has
discussed the impact of carbon markets on factors such as green
technological innovation (Xu and Cui, 2020), these studies have
not explicitly examined such factors as mechanisms for carbon
reduction. This study fills that gap by conducting a detailed
analysis of green technological innovation, fiscal effects, and
digitalization effects, providing valuable insights for a deeper
understanding of carbon markets. Thirdly, by employing an
evolutionary game model, this study segments the development
process of China’s carbon market into three distinct stages,
addressing another gap in the existing literature.
On the other hand, the study hypothesizes that the interaction
between government and enterprises introduces distinct characteristics to the development of carbon markets. An evolutionary
game model was constructed to analyze this interaction. The
results demonstrate that China’s carbon market exhibits notable
developmental phases: from an initial stage of low participation
enthusiasm by both government and enterprises to a
government-dominated stage and finally to a stage of market
dominance. This phased progression is significant both for validating the research hypothesis and for reflecting the realities of
China’s carbon market development. Furthermore, insights into
the mechanisms and heterogeneity of the carbon market’s effects
provide valuable implications for understanding its influence.
The research holds theoretical and practical significance. At the
theoretical level, it enriches the application of evolutionary game
theory in carbon market studies and demonstrates the use of
machine learning algorithms to evaluate the effectiveness of
carbon markets. These contributions are crucial for addressing
debates surrounding carbon markets and advancing methodological approaches in this field. Furthermore, this study also provides new methodological support for the quantitative assessment
of the effectiveness of carbon markets. To a large extent, the new
approach helps overcome the limitations of traditional economic
models in handling nonlinear policy feedback. These innovations
offer scholars a fresh perspective for studying carbon market
issues. At the practical level, the study delineates the phased
developmental trajectory of carbon markets, offering scientific

evidence for policymakers to adopt differentiated measures at
various stages. It identifies the pivotal roles of technological
innovation, fiscal effects, and digitalization in carbon emission
reduction. These findings provide direct guidance for policymaking in China’s carbon market development and for practices
aimed at achieving high-quality economic growth. Furthermore,
this study also provides new methodological support for the
quantitative assessment of the effectiveness of carbon markets. To
a large extent, the new approach helps overcome the limitations
of traditional economic models in handling nonlinear policy
feedback. These innovations offer scholars a fresh perspective for
studying carbon market issues.

Conclusion and recommendation
Conclusion. This paper comprehensively analyzes the effectiveness, mechanisms, and development paths of China’s carbon
market from both theoretical and empirical perspectives. It uses
machine learning methods to identify carbon emission reduction
effects. Additionally, this paper establishes an evolutionary game
model between government and enterprises to analyze the specific
pathways through which enterprises integrate into the carbon
market, making a potential contribution to deepening the
understanding of the carbon market under the 30 · 60 target.
This paper finds that: (1) The construction of the carbon
market needs to go through three stages: lack of enthusiasm from
both the government and enterprises, government dominance,
and market dominance. The relative changes in the costs and
benefits of the government and enterprises lead to a continuous
decline in the government’s dominant power and an increasing
role in the market. (2) The carbon market can achieve carbon
emission reduction effects through technological innovation
effect, fiscal effect, and digitalization effect. Moreover, the Carbon
market does not result in large-scale substitution of labor by
enterprises. (3) The heterogeneity test shows that regions with
more developed carbon markets and more advanced industrial
structures experience more significant carbon emission reduction
effects. Furthermore, the resource curse effect in the field of
environmental regulation is also evident in the process of building
China’s carbon market.

Policy implication. The research conclusions have important
policy implications for improving China’s carbon market construction and achieving carbon reduction goals: (1) The carbon
market should emphasize its significant value in environmental
pollution and carbon emission management, and further expand
its coverage. Currently, China’s carbon market construction is
still primarily based on administrative intervention, with market
mechanisms in a secondary role. Although this study supports the
effectiveness of the carbon market, the limitations of government
scale and capacity hinder deeper carbon reduction in the later
stages. Therefore, further improvement of regional and national
carbon markets is crucial. It includes continuously expanding the
carbon market’s coverage and enhancing its liquidity and vitality.
These measures ensure fairness and transparency in quota allocation, emission trading, and regulatory compliance for enterprises. (2) Enterprises should integrate development and
environmental protection goals to better achieve high-quality
development. This study finds that carbon market has significantly promoted technological innovation and digital transformation in enterprises, aligning with the requirements for highquality corporate development. Therefore, enterprises should
strengthen their capabilities in technological and management
innovation, focusing on cultivating highly skilled, specialized, and
multidisciplinary talent. Continuously improving resource allocation and management capabilities while seizing opportunities


in digital transformation and industrial upgrading will promote
high-quality development at the micro level and green development at the macro social level. (3) The government should play a
leading role in carbon governance actions and timely intervene in
enterprise carbon reduction efforts through administrative measures. This study finds that the government’s role is crucial in the
early stages of carbon market construction. The government
should formulate differentiated policies for enterprises of different sizes and industries, such as carbon taxes, production
restrictions, and carbon trading quotas. Additionally, financial
subsidies, tax reductions, and other incentive measures should be
provided to encourage active participation in carbon reduction. In
addition, establishing an orderly financial system complementary
to the carbon market and playing the role of “regulator” is
necessary to ensure the orderly operation of the carbon market
and the organized implementation of carbon emission reduction
effects. (4) A systematic, comprehensive, and regular approach
should be adopted to advance carbon reduction tasks and achieve
carbon reduction goals, avoiding issues such as regional carbon
leakage and resource curse in environmental regulation. The
central government needs to develop comprehensive carbon
reduction policies and plans, clearly defining reduction targets
and pathways. Local governments, under guidance, should formulate practical measures to steadily promote actions to replace
fossil energy with green energy, achieving an energy structure
transformation. Additionally, increasing efforts to promote carbon reduction actions and enhancing public participation and
enthusiasm are crucial. In summary, systematically advancing
carbon reduction requires the joint participation of all stakeholders, including governments, enterprises, and consumers. (5)
Other countries, especially developing countries, can learn from
China’s three-stage approach to carbon market construction to
accelerate the achievement of carbon emission management.
Other countries can adopt China’s experience to address policy
adjustments, regulatory gaps, and other issues that may arise
during the development of the carbon market. China’s successful
experience in carbon market construction also provides a reference path and model for other developing countries.

Limitation and future recommendation. Although the research
results have made certain contributions to the study of carbon
markets, there are still some shortcomings. On the one hand,
there may be a resource curse effect in the short term in the
construction of China’s carbon market because the government’s
response to environmental protection is long-term and dynamic.
However, this effect may change in the long run. Unfortunately,
due to the limited time span of the data, this paper does not test
the long-term effects of the resource curse effect. On the other
hand, although research generally believes that the main impact
of carbon markets is on carbon emissions, it is difficult for
emission control entities to separate carbon emissions from
emissions of other pollutants (such as carbon dioxide and sulfur
compounds) in reality. This also means that the construction of
carbon markets may produce synergistic effects, whereby carbon
markets not only promote carbon reduction but also reduce
emissions of other pollutants. This logic seems to be valid in
theory. However, whether this logic is a natural reality or the
effect of carbon markets may require further research for specific
elucidation.
The initial phase of building a nationwide carbon market in
China creates significant research potential. Using market
mechanisms to achieve such a large-scale carbon reduction in
China is unprecedented. Moreover, China’s unique relationship
between the government and the market also makes China’s
carbon market attractive and promising for research. China’s

innovations in carbon pricing, carbon taxes, carbon quotas, and
other measures also provide valuable lessons for global carbon
reduction efforts. In conclusion, in-depth research on China’s
carbon market and carbon reduction measures has profound
research potential.
