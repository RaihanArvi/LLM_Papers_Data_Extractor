# I n Paris in 2015, countries renewed their commitment to address climate change. As part of the Paris Agreement, each country put forward a “nationally determined

contribution” toward the common goal of limiting global warming. This ­bottom-up
approach of voluntary pledges will put the focus on national mitigation policies. At
the center of these policies should be an effort to put a price on greenhouse gas
emissions such as carbon dioxide (CO ​​ ​ ​ 2 ​​​), by issuing tradable emission permits or
through a carbon tax [1] (Arrow et al. 1997, Howard and Sylvan 2015, IMF 2017),
where most economists favor a tax (see, e.g., Nordhaus 2008, 2013 and Weitzman
2015, 2016). Public support for carbon taxes are, however, generally low, and people
tend to believe they are environmentally inefficient, although when provided with
evidence that they indeed reduce emissions, the support for carbon taxes increases
(Murray and Rivers 2015, Carattini et al. 2016). Few countries, however, have implemented carbon taxes, and there are, surprisingly, even fewer ­ex post empirical studies of their causal effect on emissions to draw from (Baranzini and Carattini 2014,
Sterner 2015). This lack of empirical studies of carbon taxes is unfortunate given the
urgency of tackling climate change, and relying on less efficient measures will make

it hard to reach current ­targets under the Paris Agreement, not to mention the even
more ambitious abatement targets that are needed if we are serious about curbing
warming to no more than 2°C above ­preindustrial levels. Correctly estimating the
effectiveness of carbon taxes empirically is thus important for shoring up much
needed public support, as well as ensuring that environmentally and economically
efficient mitigation policies are adopted across countries by the diffusion of lessons
from existing national climate policies (Carraro et al. 2015).
I investigate empirically the environmental efficiency of carbon taxes by analyzing the Swedish experience of introducing a carbon tax on transport fuels in
the early 1990s. Sweden was one of the first countries in the world to implement a
carbon tax in 1991. It was introduced at the level of US$30 per ton of CO ​​ ​ ​ 2 ​​​ and then
successively increased to today’s rate of US$132, currently the highest carbon tax
in the world (Kossoy et al. 2015). In the year prior, in March of 1990, Sweden also
extended the coverage of its existing ­value-added tax (VAT) to include gasoline and
diesel (Swedish Government ­1989–1990). The VAT rate of 25 percent is applied to
all components of the retail price: the production cost of the transport fuel, producer
margin, and any added excise taxes.
The Swedish carbon tax mainly affects the transport sector. Today, around
90 percent of the revenues from the carbon tax comes from the consumption of
gasoline and motor diesel (Ministry of Finance 2017). When implemented, large
sectors of the economy, especially industry and agriculture, received a considerably lower carbon tax rate because of concerns of international competitiveness
and carbon leakage, and fuels used for electricity production were fully exempted
from paying the tax (Johansson 2000, Hammar and Åkerfeldt 2011). In addition,
in 1991, the energy tax on fossil fuels was reduced by 50 percent for industry,
leading to a combined tax rate that was slightly lower than before the reform. In
fact, the Swedish EPA (1995) analyzed all sectors that were covered by the carbon tax and found that, besides transport, it was only for heating that the carbon
tax had an effect on emissions. I expect the impact on heating to have been small
however, as in 1991, only around 37 percent of heating fuels were fossil fuel based
(Swedish Energy Agency 2017). Furthermore, a reduction in the energy tax rate
meant that the total tax for heating oil was on the whole almost unaffected by
the introduction of the carbon tax (Hammar and Åkerfeldt 2011). The transport
sector, though, is fully covered by the carbon tax and thus a suitable sector to
analyze. [2] It is also Sweden’s largest source of CO ​​ ​ ​ 2 ​​​ emissions—from 1990–2005
the sector was responsible for close to 40 percent of total annual CO ​​ ​ ​ 2 ​​​ emissions
(Ministry of the Environment and Energy 2009).
In the first half of this paper, I estimate empirically the reduction of CO ​​ ​ ​ 2 ​​​ emissions in the transport sector using panel data and the synthetic control method
(Abadie and Gardeazabal 2003; Abadie, Diamond, and Hainmueller 2010, 2015).
From a carefully chosen control group of OECD countries, I construct the counterfactual, “synthetic Sweden”: a comparable unit consisting of a weighted combination of countries that did not implement carbon taxes or similar policies during the

2 Fuels used for domestic aviation are exempt from energy and carbon taxation as well as VAT. Domestic aviation, however, is only responsible for 3.5 percent of transport’s CO ​ ​ ​ ​ 2 ​ ​ ​ emissions (Hammar and Åkerfeldt 2011).

treatment period and that prior to treatment resemble Sweden on a number of key
predictors of CO ​​ ​ ​ 2 ​​​ emissions in the transport sector and have similar levels and paths
of these emissions. The synthetic control method provides an estimated emission
reduction from the transport sector of 10.9 percent, or 2.5 million metric tons, in an
average year during 1990–2005—the chosen ­posttreatment period of interest in this

paper.
In the second half of this paper, I disentangle the carbon tax and VAT effect by
first estimating tax and price elasticities of demand for gasoline in Sweden. [3] To
this end, I use ­time-series analysis of the consumption and price of gasoline in
Sweden during 1970–2011. Exploiting yearly changes to the carbon tax rate and
the carbon ­tax-exclusive price of gasoline (the total gas price minus the carbon
tax), I find that the carbon tax elasticity of demand is around three times larger
than the price elasticity. Using the estimated carbon tax and price elasticities—
together with the estimated emission reductions from using the synthetic control
method—I then disentangle the effect of the carbon tax on emissions from the
effect of the VAT. From the carbon tax alone I estimate a ­posttreatment reduction of 6.3 percent, or 1.5 million metric tons of CO ​​ ​ ​ 2 ​​​ emissions in an average
year. This result is in contrast to earlier empirical studies that find no effect from
the Swedish carbon tax on domestic transport CO ​​ ​ ​ 2 ​​​ emissions (Bohlin 1998, Lin
and Li 2011), and the estimated reduction is 40 percent larger than an earlier simulation study finds (Ministry of the Environment and Energy 2009). In fact, my
finding differs from all earlier empirical studies of carbon taxes, which find that
the taxes have had very small to no effect on CO ​​ ​ ​ 2 ​​​ emissions in the countries that
implemented them (Bohlin 1998, Bruvoll and Larsen 2004, and Lin and Li 2011).
This is thus the first ­quasi-experimental study to find a significant causal effect of
a carbon tax on emissions.

There are a number of advantages to using the synthetic control method when
it comes to evaluating the environmental effects of carbon taxation. First, with
the synthetic control method we use ­ex post empirical data on CO ​​ ​ ​ 2 ​​​ emissions as
the outcome variable, and there is thus no need to use a simulation approach to
estimate changes to emissions. Earlier studies of the environmental effect of carbon taxes—or transport fuel taxes in general—are typically ­ex ante (or ­ex post)
simulations, using price elasticities of demand for gasoline to estimate reductions
in consumption of transport fuel (see, e.g., Rivers and Schaufele 2015; Li, Linn,
and Muehlegger 2014; Davis and Kilian 2011; and Ministry of the Environment
and Energy 2009). Changes to the consumption of gasoline are in these studies
used as a proxy for total changes in CO ​​ ​ ​ 2 ​​​ emissions from the transport sector or the
economy as a whole.
There are, however, a number of problems with this simulation approach. There
is now growing evidence that consumers respond more strongly to tax changes compared to equivalent price changes, especially in the gasoline market. A number of
studies find that the tax elasticity is two and a half to four times larger than the price
elasticity. Simulations that use price elasticities of demand thus underestimate the

3
I focus on gasoline since 95 percent of CO ​ ​ ​ ​ 2 ​ ​ ​ emissions in the transport sector come from road transport
(Ministry of the Environment and Energy 2009), where gasoline is the main fuel used (see Figure 2).

true causal effect of carbon taxes on CO ​​ ​ ​ 2 ​​​ emissions. Furthermore, by ­focusing on
changes in demand for only gasoline, these earlier studies don’t account for substitution between fuels, most notably from gasoline to diesel, [4] as well as substitution
between modes of transport. In Europe, the share of passenger cars using diesel
as engine fuel is in many countries equal to the share that uses gasoline (Eurostat
2017). This is a different situation compared with the United States and Canada
where gasoline is overwhelmingly the main fuel used in passenger cars (Chambers
and Schmitt 2015). The increased share of diesel in Europe is an important form of
adaptation to higher fuel taxes since the diesel engine offers significantly better fuel
efficiency (Sterner 2006). The difference in the vehicle fleet between Europe and
North America may thus be seen as a direct response to comparatively higher fuel
taxes in Europe. In Sweden, the percentage of passenger cars using diesel in 1991
was 2.7 percent; this share increased to 5.2 percent in 2005 and 29.6 percent in 2015
(Eurostat 2017). This substitution is important to capture when evaluating the effect
of environmental taxation in the transportation sector, as a failure to do so will bias
the results. [5]

An additional benefit of looking at transport emissions directly is that we capture
all fuel demand adjustments made on the extensive margin in response to a carbon
tax, such as an increased use of public transport. Buses used for public transport
typically use diesel as engine fuel.
Second, in the setting of this paper, with only one treated unit and the use of
aggregated data, the synthetic control method has some advantages over the
­differences-in-differences (DiD) estimator frequently used in comparative case studies. Besides simulations, the use of the DiD estimator is the most common research
design in evaluations of the effects of carbon taxes (see, e.g., Elgie and McClay
2013, Lin and Li 2011). To begin with, the synthetic control method relaxes the
parallel trends assumption that underlies the DiD estimator by allowing the effects
of unobserved confounders on emissions to vary over time (Abadie, Diamond,
and Hainmueller 2010). Furthermore, with the inclusion of predictors of CO ​​ ​ ​ 2 ​​​ emissions from the transport sector, we weigh the units in the control group so as to create
a comparison unit that most resembles Sweden. Addition of these covariates, such
as level of urbanization and number of motor vehicles per capita, is not possible in
the DiD regression as they are likely affected by the implementation of the carbon
tax—themselves being outcome variables—and are thus considered “bad controls.”
With the synthetic control method, we use the predictive power of the covariates
to construct a convincing counterfactual, without the confounding effect of having
them included ­posttreatment. With DiD there is also often an ambiguity in the choice
of comparison units (see, e.g., Card 1990, Lin and Li 2011), whereas the synthetic

4 Rivers and Schaufele (2015, 32), analyzing the carbon tax in British Columbia, Canada, acknowledges this in a
footnote: “Note that the BC carbon tax affects all fossil fuels consumed in the province, not just gasoline. However,
our analysis is restricted to the impact of the carbon tax on gasoline sales.”
5 Davis and Kilian (2011, 1210) simulates carbon emission reductions from an increase of the gasoline tax in the
United States, and admits, also in a footnote, that their results assume away any substitution: “This estimate presumes
that substitution away from gasoline does not raise greenhouse gas emissions. To the extent that consumers substitute
from gasoline to other ­carbon-producing goods, the aggregate reductions will be overestimated by our approach.”
Although the authors refer to “ ­carbon-producing goods” in general, the argument also applies to a possible substitution between different transport fuels.

control method chooses them through a ­data-driven method. Lastly, in the synthetic
control framework, the relative contribution of each control unit is made explicit, and
we can analyze the similarities, or lack thereof, between our selected synthetic control and the treated unit, on the ­pre-intervention outcomes and observable predictors
of the ­post-intervention outcomes.
In addition to the merits of using empirical ­ex post data on emissions and a
synthetic control, my paper contributes to the empirical literature on carbon taxation on a few other dimensions. First, Sweden’s geographical location makes
it less susceptible to carbon leakage from the transport sector, leaving estimated
emission reductions unbiased. Sweden is a peninsula in the most northern region
of Europe, only sharing land border with Norway along a de-populated area of
Sweden. Gasoline prices in Norway are also, on average, 15 percent higher than
in Sweden during the ­posttreatment period, making ­cross-border shopping of fuel
by Swedes unlikely (IEA 2019). This is a different situation than, for instance, the
carbon tax that was implemented in British Columbia, Canada, in 2008—studied
in Rivers and Schaufele (2015) and Elgie and McClay (2013). British Columbia is
surrounded by other Canadian states and the United States in three out of four directions. There is thus an obvious risk of carbon leakage, evidence of which is reported
in Antweiler and Gulati (2016).
Second, since Sweden implemented a carbon tax as early as 1991, my paper is
better able to capture ­long-term changes to behavior. The 16 years of ­posttreatment
data in my study can be compared with the 4 years in Rivers and Schaufele (2015).
Fuel demand adjusts in response to a carbon tax on two different margins: the intensive, changes in mileage driven; and the extensive, buying a more ­fuel-efficient car
or using alternative transportation means, such as public transport or a bicycle. With
Sweden as our case study, we are able to capture adjustments made on both of these
margins.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section I presents the Swedish
carbon tax. Section II presents the data and methods used for the estimation of emission reductions. Section III presents the results of the empirical analysis as well as
several robustness checks. Section IV disentangles the carbon tax effect from the
VAT. Section V compares the paper’s findings with earlier studies and discusses
general lessons to take away from the study. Finally, Section VI concludes.

**I. The Swedish Carbon Tax**

Sweden is a small, open economy with a population of 9.5 million and a nominal
GDP per capita that ranked it as the eleventh richest country in the world in 2015
(IMF 2016). With regard to climate change policies, in 1991, Sweden was one of the
first countries in the world to implement a carbon tax. The tax was first suggested
by the Social Democrats in 1988, citing the threat of climate change, and signed
into law by the Social Democratic government in 1990 (Collier and Löfstedt 1997,
Swedish Government ­1989–1990). The full carbon tax rate is levied on heating fuels
(used by households) and transport fuels. Measures to combat climate change had
broad political support in the late ’80s and early ’90s, but concerns about international competitiveness and carbon leakage meant that industry paid only 25 percent


-----

*6* *AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: ECONOMIC POLICY * *NOVEMBER 2019*

of the full rate. [6] This differential has changed over the years—industry paid from
21–50 percent of the general carbon tax rate in the years 1991–2005, and today
industry pays 80 percent of the full rate. Owing to the lower rate paid, and coupled
with a reduction in the existing energy tax and a relatively small reliance on fossil
fuels (less than 30 percent) for the energy supply, the impact of the carbon tax on
the Swedish industry has been rather limited (Johansson 2000, Swedish Energy
Agency 2017).
The carbon tax was introduced at US$30 per ton of CO ​​ ​ ​ 2 ​​​ and increased slightly
during the 1990s to US$44 in 2000. Then, from 2001–2004, the rate was increased
in a ­step-by-step manner to US$109. Today, in 2018, the rate is US$132 per ton of
CO ​​ ​ ​ 2 ​​​, the world’s highest CO ​​ ​ ​ 2 ​​​ tax imposed on ­non-trading sectors and households. [7]
The final tax rates applied to fossil fuels are set in accordance with their carbon
content. For example, the combustion of one litre of gasoline releases 2.323 kg of
CO ​​ ​ ​ 2 ​​​. The carbon tax rate of 0.25 SEK per kg of CO ​​ ​ ​ 2 ​​​ (1 SEK US$0.12) in 1991
=
thus equated to an addition to the consumer price of gasoline of 0.58 SEK per liter.
When the carbon tax was implemented, it complemented an existing energy tax
that was added to the price of gasoline as early as 1924 and diesel in 1937 (Speck
2008). With the addition of VAT of 25 percent in 1990, the retail price of gasoline
and diesel today consists of a ­tax-exclusive price ​​ *p* *t* ​ ​​​, energy tax ​​τ ​ *t*, *energy* ​​​, carbon tax ​​
τ *t* ​, ​ *CO ​* 2 ​​​, and a ­value-added tax ​​

(1) *p* ​​ ​ *t* [∗] ​ ​ =  ​ ( *p* ​ *t* ​ ​​ +  ​τ *t* ​, *energy* ​​ +  ​τ *t* ​, *C ​O* 2 ​ ​​ ​​ ) *VA* ​ *T* ​ *t* ​ ​​​.

Figure 1, panel A, shows that the real ( ­inflation-adjusted) energy tax applied
to gasoline was fairly constant from 1960–2000, before decreasing in the years
­2001–2005. [8] This decrease was counteracted by a simultaneous increase in the carbon tax rate, sustaining the upward trend in the total tax, as evident in Figure 1,
panel B. The total tax rate increased by 39 percent in 1990 and more than 82 percent
between 1989–2005—from 4 SEK to over 7 SEK per liter. Figure 2 plots per capita
consumption of gasoline and diesel during ­1960–2005 (World Bank 2015). The figure gives a descriptive indication that the carbon tax and VAT had an impact on the
consumption of transport fuel and that consumers substituted gasoline for diesel in
response to the large increase in taxes.

6 The economic effects of the domestic recession between ­1991–1993 may also have factored in (Swedish
Government 1991–1992). Sweden’s economic problems in the early 1990s started in the housing and financial
sectors but soon affected the economy as a whole. An earlier expansion of credit (and debt), coupled with an
overvalued currency, had made the economy vulnerable to adverse shocks. From mid-1990 to mid-1993, GDP
dropped by a total of 6 percent and unemployment went from 3 to 10 percent of the labor force. The economy and
the banking sector eventually stabilized in the summer of 1993, following the decision in late 1992 to move from a
fixed to a floating exchange rate.
7 Total revenue from the Swedish carbon tax constituted 1.75 percent of government revenues in 2006 and is
not ­ear-marked for any specific purpose when entering the governmental budget. The administrative cost for the tax
authority is also low, around 0.1 percent of total revenues from the tax (Withana et al. 2013).
8 In Section IV, I estimate how much larger total emission reductions would have been if the energy tax rate
had stayed constant between 2001–2005. Note also that the VAT rate is constant during the entire time period of
our analysis, acting as a multiplier of movements in the other price components—thus, taking the value of 1, in
equation (1), for years prior to 1990, and 1.25 thereafter.

*Tax Incidence* .—An important question for our subsequent analysis of the effect
on emissions is to what extent fuel taxes are borne by consumers. If the carbon tax
is fully passed through to consumers, that will result in higher prices at the fuel
pump, and higher prices reduce demand and thus fuel use, resulting in lower CO ​​ ​ ​ 2 ​​​
emissions from the transport sector. Furthermore, if tax changes are fully passed on
to consumers, we can view estimated tax elasticities as demand elasticities.


-----

*8* *AMERICAN ECONOMIC JOURNAL: ECONOMIC POLICY * *NOVEMBER 2019*

I analyze empirically the question of tax incidence by decomposing the Swedish
retail price of gasoline into oil prices and excise taxes. Using ­first-differences, I
regress the nominal ­tax-inclusive price of gasoline during ­time-period ​ *t* ​ on the crude
oil price, and excise taxes

(2) Δ ​ ​ *p* ​ [∗] *t* ​ ​ =  ​α 0 ​ ​​ +  ​α 1 ​ ​​ Δ  ​θ *t* ​ ​​ +  ​α 2 ​ ​​ Δ  ​τ *t* ​ ​​ +  ​ϵ *t* ​ ​​​,

where ​​ *p* ​ *t* [∗] ​ ​​ is the retail price of gasoline, ​​θ ​ *t* ​​​ is the crude oil price, and ​​τ ​ *t* ​​​ is the sum of
the energy and carbon tax (I exclude VAT and the producer margin from the model).
Using yearly data from 1970–2015 ( *N* ​ = 45 ​), I find an estimate for the coefficient
on taxes of 1.15 (95 percent confidence interval of [0. ­90–1.39]). The coefficient is
statistically indistinguishable from 1, and the data thus indicate that tax changes are
borne heavily by consumers. Furthermore, I split up the total tax into its energy and
carbon tax part. The result stays unchanged—the coefficients being 1.17 [0. ­91–1.43]
for the nominal energy tax and 1.00 [0. ­70–1.29] for the nominal carbon tax, both
statistically indistinguishable from 1. Changes to the Swedish energy and carbon
tax rates are thus both fully passed through to consumers, a result similarly found
in studies of US gasoline taxes by, among others, Marion and Muehlegger (2011);
Davis and Kilian (2011); and Li, Linn, and Muehlegger (2014).

**II. Empirical Methodology**

A. *Data*

To empirically analyze the effect on emissions from the environmental tax reform
in 1990–1991, I use annual panel data on per capita CO ​​ ​ ​ 2 ​​​ emissions from transport
for the years 1960–2005 for 25 OECD countries, including Sweden. [9] The outcome
variable is measured in metric tons, and the data, obtained from the World Bank
(2015), contains emissions from the combustion of fuel (taken to be equal to the
fuel sold) from road, rail, domestic navigation, and domestic aviation, excluding
international aviation and international marine bunkers. For all the OECD countries

in my sample, transport emissions are calculated based on empirical data on the
sale of transport fuels and their carbon content, with the data typically available
from national statistical agencies. For road vehicles, emissions are attributed to the
country where the fuel is sold (Eggleston et al. 2008). By focusing on CO ​​ ​ ​ 2 ​​​ emissions from the combustion of all transport fuels, and not only gasoline, we capture
changes in demand for fuel in the different modes of transport, as well as substitutions made between fuels, most notably between gasoline and diesel.
I choose 2005 as the end date because that year was the start of the European
Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS), one of the main building blocks of
the EU’s climate change policy, and also because many countries in the sample
implemented carbon taxes or made marked changes to fuel taxation from 2005 and

9 Included are the 24 countries that were OECD members in 1990 plus Poland, which became a member in 1996
and is geographically close to Sweden.

*VOL. 11 NO. 4 * *ANDERSSON: CARBON TAXES AND CO* 2 *EMISSIONS* *9*

onward. The sample period hence gives me 30 years of ­pretreatment data and 16
years of ­posttreatment data, which is sufficient to construct a viable counterfactual
and enough time ­posttreatment to evaluate the effect of the policy changes.
From this initial sample of 25 OECD countries, I exclude countries that during
the sample period enacted carbon taxes that cover the transport sector, in this case
Finland, Norway, and the Netherlands, or made large changes to fuel taxes, which
exclude Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom. [10] Additionally, I exclude Austria
and Luxembourg because of “fuel tourism” distorting their emissions data (Sterner
2006). Austria’s emissions data is skewed from the year 1999 and onward. This is due
to Austria lowering fuel taxes in 1999, while neighboring Germany and Italy increased
their fuel taxes the same year. Austria is a major transit country, and large trucks in particular tend to fill up in countries with low diesel prices on their way through Europe. In
2005, diesel sales in Austria were 150 percent higher than a decade earlier, a clear indication that “fuel tourism” had taken place. Luxembourg has had lower fuel taxes than
neighbouring European countries for many years, which explains them having five
to eight times higher per capita consumption of fuel than their neighbors (European
Federation for Transport and Environment 2011), and thus more than two times higher
per capita CO ​​ ​ ​ 2 ​​​ emissions from transport than the next highest emitter in the sample.
Similarly, I omit Turkey, which had average per capita emissions in the ­pretreatment
period way below the other countries in the sample. Lastly, I exclude Ireland because
of their unique economic expansion in the 1990s—the “Celtic Tiger”—that more than
doubled their GDP per capita and CO ​​ ​ ​ 2 ​​​ emissions per capita from transport during
the ­posttreatment period. This rapid economic expansion is dissimilar to Sweden’s
and the other donor countries’ development during the same time period. We exclude
Turkey and Ireland to avoid interpolation bias: including countries in the donor pool
with important characteristics that are very different from Sweden (Abadie, Diamond,
and Hainmueller 2015). Note, however, that my main results from using the synthetic
control method are identical and unaffected by whether or not Austria, Luxembourg,
Turkey, or Ireland are included in the sample, since these four countries all obtain zero
weight in synthetic Sweden. Furthermore, as will be evident in the result section, the
estimated emission reductions from comparing Sweden with its synthetic counterpart
are never driven by any one single country in the donor pool.
In the end, my donor pool consists of 14 countries: Australia, Belgium, Canada,
Denmark, France, Greece, Iceland, Japan, New Zealand, Poland, Portugal, Spain,
Switzerland, and the United States.

B. *The Synthetic Control Method*

The ­DiD estimator, commonly used in comparative case studies, constructs the
counterfactual using an unweighted average of the outcome variable from the control group. An estimate of the emission reduction (the “treatment” effect) is gained
by comparing the change in the outcome variable pre- and ­posttreatment, for the

10 Denmark also implemented a carbon tax, in 1992. Their tax level, however, is set relatively low—US$24 in
2015 (Kossoy et al. 2015)—and, more importantly, the transport sector is exempted.

comparative studies is that, by taking time differences, it eliminates the influence of
unobserved covariates that predict the outcome variable, assuming that the effects
on the outcome variable are constant over time. A further assumption is that any
macroeconomic shocks, or other time effects, are common to the treated unit and
the control group. Together, these two assumptions are usually referred to as the
“parallel trends assumption,” implying in our case that, in the absence of a carbon
tax and VAT, CO ​​ ​ ​ 2 ​​​ emissions from the transport sector in Sweden and our control
group follow parallel paths.
The parallel trends assumption is difficult to verify, which is a drawback for the
DiD method. It is sometimes possible ­pretreatment by analyzing the trends of the
outcome variable, but obviously impossible after treatment. When the treated unit
and the control group do not follow a common trend, the DiD estimator will be
biased. Therefore, finding a method that relaxes the parallel trends assumption is
preferable for comparative case studies. The synthetic control method allows the
effects of unobserved confounders on the outcome variable to vary over time by
weighting the control group, so that prior to treatment it resembles Sweden on a
number of key predictors of CO ​​ ​ ​ 2 ​​​ emissions in the transport sector and has similar
levels and paths of emissions. Thus, by relaxing the parallel trends assumption, the
synthetic control method improves upon the DiD estimator.
Let ​ *J* + 1 ​ be the number of OECD countries in my sample, indexed by ​ *j* ​, and

=
let ​ *j* 1 ​ denote Sweden, the “treated unit.” The units in the sample are observed
for time periods ​ *t* = 1, 2, …, *T* ​, and it is important to have data on a sufficient
amount of time periods prior to treatment ​1, 2, …,  ​ *T* ​ 0 ​​​ as well as posttreatment ​​
*T* 0 ​ ​​ + 1,  ​ *T* 0 ​ ​​ + 2, …, *T* ​ to be able to construct a synthetic Sweden *and* evaluate the
effect of the treatment. Synthetic Sweden is constructed as a weighted average of
the control countries ​ *j* = 2, …, *J* + 1 ​ and represented by a vector of weights ​ *W*
= ( *w* ​ 2 ​ ​​, …,  ​ *w* *J* ​ +1 ​​)′ ​ with ​0 ≤  ​ *w* *j* ​ ​​ ≤ 1 ​ and ​​ *w* 2 ​ ​​ + ⋯ +  ​ *w* *J* ​ +1 ​​ = 1 ​. Each choice of ​ *W* ​
gives a certain set of weights and hence characterizes a possible synthetic control.
We choose ​ *W* ​ so that the difference between Sweden and the control units on a
number of key predictors of the outcome variable and the outcome variable itself is
minimized in the ­pretreatment period, subject to the above (convexity) constraints.
As key predictors, I use GDP per capita, number of motor vehicles, gasoline consumption per capita, and percentage of urban population. [11] The level of GDP per
capita is shown in the literature to be closely linked to emissions of greenhouse
gases, and OECD countries that are less urbanized have a higher usage of motor
vehicles and hence higher emissions from transport (Neumayer 2004). I average the
four key predictors over the ­1980–1989 period. Finally, to the list of predictors, I add
three lagged years of CO ​​ ​ ​ 2 ​​​ emissions: 1970, 1980, and 1989.
The predictors are in turn assigned weights to allow more weight to be given
relative important predictors of the outcome variable. There are various methods
available for selecting the diagonal matrix of predictor weights ​ *V*, ​ for instance, by
assigning weights based on empirical findings in the literature on the main drivers
of CO ​​ ​ ​ 2 ​​​ emissions, or ­cross-validation methods (Abadie, Diamond, and Hainmueller

2015). In this paper, however, ​ *V* ​ and the vector of country weights ​ *W* ​ are jointly chosen so that they minimize the mean squared prediction error (MSPE) of the outcome
variable over the entire ­pretreatment period. [12]

With a large number of ­pre-intervention periods, an accurate prediction of the
outcome variable during these years makes it more plausible that unobserved and
­time-varying confounders affect the treated unit and the synthetic counterpart in a
similar way (Kreif et al. 2016). The intuition is that synthetic Sweden is only able to
reproduce the level and trend of CO ​​ ​ ​ 2 ​​​ emissions from the transport sector in Sweden
for the 30 years before treatment, if it is true that the two units are similar when it
comes to observed as well as unobserved predictors and the effects of these predictors on emissions.

**III. Results**

Figure 3 shows the trajectory of emissions from transport in Sweden and the
average of the 14 OECD countries during the sample period. [13] Overall, before
1990, emissions seem to follow a similar trend, but the fit is poor in the 1980s. A
­statistical analysis shows that on average, from 1960–1989, emissions in Sweden

12 To find ​ *V* ​ and ​ *W* ​, I use a statistical package for R called Synth (Abadie, Diamond, and Hainmueller 2011).
13 The slump in emissions in Sweden and the OECD countries in the years following 1979 is a response to what
is commonly called the “second oil crisis,” prompted by the Iranian Revolution in 1979. It wasn’t until around 1986
that the price of oil was back down at ­pre-1979 levels. This increase in the oil price hence acts as a “natural experiment” that shows that increased prices of fuel leads to reductions in CO ​ ​ ​ ​ 2 ​ ​ ​ emissions from transport.

and the OECD average grew at a similar pace. Between 1980–1989, however, emissions in Sweden grew twice as fast, a difference in trend that is statistically significant. This result indicates that the common trends assumption underlying the
­differences-in-differences estimator is violated and that the result if we used a DiD
framework would be biased. [14] So, let’s turn to the synthetic control method and see
if it produces more promising results.

A. *Sweden versus Synthetic Sweden*

If synthetic Sweden is able to track CO ​​ ​ ​ 2 ​​​ emissions from transport in Sweden
in the ­pretreatment period and reproduce the values of the key predictors, it lends
credibility to our identification assumption that the synthetic control unit provides
the path of emissions from 1990–2005 in the absence of taxes.
Figure 4 shows that, prior to treatment, emissions from transport in Sweden and
its synthetic counterpart track each other closely—an average (absolute) difference of only around 0.03 metric tons of CO ​​ ​ ​ 2 ​​​. Hence, the synthetic control doesn’t
underestimate the treatment effect in the way that the DiD estimator does by failing
to capture the trend in the last ten years before treatment. Furthermore, Table 1
compares the values of the key predictors for Sweden prior to 1990 with the same
values for synthetic Sweden and a ­population-weighted average of the 14 OECD

14 See the online Appendix for the result from a DiD estimate of the treatment effect.

­countries in the donor pool. For all predictors, except gasoline consumption per
capita, Sweden and its synthetic version have almost identical values and a much
better fit compared with the OECD average. It is especially encouraging to see the
good fit on GDP per capita.
The predictors are weighted (the ​ *V* ​ matrix) as follows: GDP per capita (0.219);
motor vehicles (0.078); gasoline consumption (0.010); urban population (0.213); and,
CO ​​ ​ ​ 2 ​​​ emissions from transport in 1989 (0.183), 1980 (0.284), and 1970 (0.013). [15] The
small weight assigned to gasoline consumption per capita may explain the poor fit
between Sweden and its synthetic version on this variable.
Lastly, the ​ *W* ​ weights reported in Table 2 show that CO ​​ ​ ​ 2 ​​​ emissions from transport in Sweden are best reproduced by a combination of Denmark, Belgium, New
Zealand, Greece, the United States, and Switzerland (with weights decreasing in
this order). The rest of the countries in the donor pool get either a weight of zero, or
close to zero. The large weight given to Denmark (0.384) is reasonable considering
that Sweden and Denmark are similar in many social and economic dimensions.
Belgium and Sweden have had a similar level and growth rate of GDP per capita—a
major predictor of CO ​​ ​ ​ 2 ​​​ emissions—from 1960–2005, whereas New Zealand and

­1960–1969)—but none gave a better fit ­pretreatment or changed the ​ *W* ​ weights and estimated emission reductions substantially. Additionally, I switched to lags of GDP instead of CO ​ ​ ​ ​ 2 ​ ​ ​, which again produced a similar result
as the main analysis.

Figure 5. Gap in Per Capita CO ​​ ​ ​ 2 ​​​ Emissions from Transport between Sweden and Synthetic Sweden

Sweden have a comparable geography (low population density) and urbanization
pattern (both level and trend is remarkably alike). Together, Denmark, Belgium, and
New Zealand make up three-fourths of synthetic Sweden.

B. *Emission Reductions*

The ­posttreatment distance between Sweden and synthetic Sweden in Figure 4
measures the reduction in CO ​​ ​ ​ 2 ​​​ emissions. This distance is further visualized in the
gap plot of Figure 5. The introduction of the VAT and the gradual increase of the
carbon tax create larger and larger reductions during the ­posttreatment period. In the
last year of the sample period, 2005, emissions from transport in Sweden are 12.5

−
percent, or 0.35 metric tons per capita, lower than they would have been in the
absence of treatment. The reduction in emissions for the 1990–2005 period is 10.9
percent, or −0.29 metric tons of CO ​​ ​ ​ 2 ​​​ per capita in an average year. Aggregating
over the total population gives an emission reduction of 3.2 million tons of CO ​​ ​ ​ 2 ​​​ in
2005 and an average for the ­1990–2005 period of 2.5 million tons of CO ​​ ​ ​ 2 ​​​. The total
cumulative reduction in emissions for the ­posttreatment period is 40.5 million tons
of CO ​​ ​ ​ 2 ​​​.
Because of the reduction of the energy tax rate in the years 2001–2005 (see
Figure 1, panel A), the simultaneous increase of the carbon tax rate is almost canceled
out during this period, leaving a nearly flat combined real tax rate. Consequently,
we can be more confident in stating that the emission reductions from 1990–2000 is
due to the introduction of the carbon tax and VAT alone, whereas for 2001–2005 the
reductions is due to changes in all three tax components—assuming that a ­similar

reduction in the energy tax rate did not take place in the countries that make up synthetic Sweden. In 2000, the last year before the energy tax was lowered, emissions

−
from transport were reduced by 11.5 percent, or 0.31 metric tons per capita.

C. *Placebo Tests*

To further test the validity of the results, I performed a series of placebo tests:
“ ­in-time,” “ ­in-space,” “ ­leave-one-out,” and “full sample.” For the ­in-time tests, the
year of treatment is shifted to 1970 and 1980, years that are both prior to the actual
environmental tax reform. For the two tests, the choice of synthetic control is based
only on data from 1960–1969 and 1960–1979, respectively. We want to find that
this placebo treatment doesn’t result in a ­post-placebo-treatment divergence in the
trajectory of emissions between Sweden and its synthetic control. A large placebo
effect casts doubt on the claim that the result illustrated in Figures 4 and 5 is the
actual causal effect of the carbon tax and the VAT. Encouragingly, Figure 6 shows
that no such divergence is found.
For the ­in-space placebo test, the treatment is iteratively reassigned to every
country in the donor pool, again using the synthetic control method to construct
synthetic counterparts. This gives us a method to establish if the result obtained for
Sweden is unusually large, by comparing that result with the placebo results for all
the countries in the donor pool. This form of permutation test allows for inference
and the calculation of ­ *p* -values: measuring the fraction of countries with results
larger than or as large as the one obtained for the treated unit (Abadie, Diamond,
and Hainmueller 2015, 6).
Figure 7 shows the results of the ­in-space placebo test. Panel A indicates that
for some countries in the donor pool, the synthetic control method is unable to
find a convex combination of countries that will replicate the path of emissions in
the ­pretreatment period. This is especially true for the United States, Poland, and

and Placebo Gaps for the Control Countries

*Notes:* Panel A shows per capita CO ​​ ​ ​ 2 ​​​ emissions gap in Sweden and placebo gaps in all 14 OECD control countries. Panel B shows per capita gap in Sweden and placebo gaps in nine OECD control countries (countries with a
­pretreatment MSPE 20 times higher than Sweden’s are excluded).

Portugal, which is not surprising since the United States has the largest CO ​​ ​ ​ 2 ​​​ emissions during all the ­pretreatment years and Poland and Portugal have the lowest.
Therefore, in panel B, all the countries with a ­pretreatment MSPE (mean squared
prediction error) at least 20 times larger than Sweden’s ­pretreatment MSPE are
excluded, which leaves 9 countries in the donor pool. Now the gap in emissions for
Sweden in the ­posttreatment period is the largest of all remaining countries. The
*p* -value of estimating a gap of this magnitude is thus 1/10 = 0.10.
Even so, the choice of a particular ­cutoff threshold for the MSPE value when
doing permutation testing is arbitrary. A better inferential method is to look at the
ratio of ­posttreatment MSPE to ­pretreatment MSPE (Abadie et al. 2010), with the
assumption that a large ratio is indicative of a true causal effect from treatment.
With the ratio test we do not have to discard countries based on an arbitrarily chosen
­cutoff rule, and thus the ratio test is advantageous when you have a small number
of control units.

Figure 8 shows that Sweden by far has the largest ratio of all the countries in the
sample. If one was to assign the treatment at random, the probability of finding a
ratio this large is 1/15 = 0.067, the smallest possible ­ *p* -value with my sample size.
For the ­leave-one-out test (Abadie, Diamond, and Hainmueller 2015), I iteratively eliminate one of the six control countries that got a ​ *W* ​ weight larger than
0.001 (0.1 percent) to check if the results are driven by one or a few influential controls. As we see from Figure 9, the main results are robust to the elimination of one
donor pool country at a time. We get slightly larger reductions when we eliminate
Denmark, slightly smaller reductions when we eliminate Switzerland or the United
States, and basically unchanged results for the others. This test thus provides us with
a range for the estimated emission reduction, from an average ­posttreatment reduction of 13.0 percent (when eliminating Denmark) to the most conservative estimate
of an 8.8 percent reduction (omitting Switzerland). The average of the six iterations

control is ­otherwise composed of Denmark, Belgium, New Zealand, and the United
States, with three-fourths of the total weight still given to the first three countries. The
two countries that drop out are Greece and Switzerland, which previously got a weight
of 0.09 and 0.06 respectively.
My main criterion for dropping countries from the sample is large changes to fuel
taxes during the sample period. Figure 4 shows that emissions in Sweden and its
synthetic counterpart track each other closely for the 30 years before the carbon tax
reform. This provides suggestive evidence that ­non-price policies haven’t had a significant effect on CO ​​ ​ ​ 2 ​​​ emissions from the Swedish transport sector, as otherwise we
expect the two series to diverge at some point from 1960–1990. ­Non-price policies
can in this context be viewed as unobserved confounders, and an advantage of the
synthetic control method is that it relaxes the parallel trends assumption by allowing
the effects of unobserved confounders on the outcome variable to vary over time.
In any case, the ­leave-one-out and full sample tests show that the main results are
neither driven by any one country alone nor that the exclusion of countries from the
donor pool impacts the estimated emission reductions.

D. *Possible Confounder*

A common argument against carbon taxation is that it will hurt economic growth.
We also find in the literature clear evidence of a link between GDP growth and
growth in CO ​​ ​ ​ 2 ​​​ emissions. Could it thus be that the introduction of the carbon tax
reduced the level of GDP in Sweden ­posttreatment, and that this is the actual driver
behind the emission reductions? Or, alternatively, is the exogenous shock of the
domestic financial and economic crisis in the early 1990s driving the results?
Figure 11 shows that GDP per capita in Sweden and its synthetic counterpart
track each other quite well during the 30 years before and 16 years after treatment. Yes, there is a reduction in real GDP per capita from 1990–1993, which is

not matched by a similar reduction in synthetic Sweden, but already by 1995 the
two series are closely aligned again. If the recession drove the reduction in emissions, we would expect to see a “bounce back” in emissions once economic growth
started to catch up again, and this we do not see.
The correlation between gaps in GDP per capita and gaps in CO ​​ ​ ​ 2 ​​​ emissions from
transport, between Sweden and its synthetic counterpart, is further illustrated in
Figure 12. This figure allows us to compare and contrast the impact on emissions
from the two major recessions in Sweden during the sample period; the first one in
­1976–1978 and the second in ­1991–1993. From the gap plot we see that the drop
in relative GDP from 1975–1978 and from 1989–1993 are similar in magnitude:
a decrease of around $2,300 per capita. The impacts on emissions are, however,
very different: from 1975–1978, CO ​​ ​ ​ 2 ​​​ emissions from transport actually increased
with +0.086 tons per capita in Sweden compared to synthetic Sweden, whereas

−
from 1989–1993 they decreased with 0.291 tons. Furthermore, in both cases, the
­catch-up in growth following the recessions was not met with an increase in relative
transport emissions. This comparison of the different effects of the two major recessions provides further evidence that the recession in the early 1990s is not the driver
of emission reductions in the ­posttreatment period.
In conclusion, there is no indication that the domestic recession in ­1991–1993
is driving emissions ­posttreatment and no observable ( ­long-term) negative effect
on GDP from the environmental tax reform. [16] Average GDP per capita in Sweden

synthetic Sweden. Figure 11, together with the gap plot in Figure 5, signals that,
since the introduction of the carbon tax, the ­long-run (positive) correlation between
GDP growth and emissions in the transport sector has weakened considerably.
There is tentative evidence that this holds for the economy as a whole: during
­1990–2013, total greenhouse gas emissions fell by 23 percent in Sweden while real
GDP increased by 61 percent (Hammar and Åkerfeldt 2015).

**IV. Disentangling the Carbon Tax and VAT**

The effect I find on transport emissions from the Swedish carbon tax and the VAT
is larger than earlier empirical analyses of carbon taxes suggest and larger than a
simulation analysis found that looked specifically at the effect on Swedish transport
emissions (Ministry of the Environment and Energy 2009). Possible explanations
for this result are that the carbon tax induces a larger behavioral response than we

­long-run levels of emissions from transport. Furthermore, prior to the environmental tax reform in the early 1990s,
large changes to the relative unemployment rate had no discernible impact on CO ​ ​ ​ ​ 2 ​ ​ ​ emissions from transport. After
the tax reform, the connection goes both ways: the large increase in unemployment from 1991 to 1993 is accompanied by a reduction in emissions, but the large *decrease* in unemployment from 1997 to ­2001–2003 is also
accompanied by a reduction in emissions. Lastly, using descriptive evidence and a regression model, I show that
the variable that coherently explains all changes in emissions, both before and after the tax reform, is changes to
the real fuel tax rate.

assume from just looking at price elasticities of demand, or that the VAT accounts
for the largest part of the total emission reductions. To examine this result further,
we turn now to the paper’s second (but complementary) empirical analysis: the disentangling of the carbon tax and VAT effect, by comparing the behavioral response
from changes to the carbon tax rate and equivalent gas price changes. I analyze this
issue by using annual ­time-series data of the consumption and real price of gasoline
in Sweden from 1970–2011. I decompose the retail price of gasoline into its carbon ­tax-exclusive price component, ​​ *p* ​ *t* *[v]* ​ ​ = *p* ​ *t* ​ ​​ +  ​τ *t* ​, *energy* ​​) *VAT* ​ *t* ​ ​​​, and the carbon tax, ​​
τ ​ *vt*, *C ​O* 2 ​ *​* ​ ​​ = ​ *t*, *C ​O* 2 ​ ​​ ​​ ) *VAT* ​ *t* ​ ​​​. Since the VAT is constant, and a multiplier, it is perfectly (
( ​τ
correlated with all price components. The VAT is hence added to each respective
price component and not treated separately. I set up the following ­log-linear (static)
model:

(3) ​ln ​ ( *x* ​ *t* ​ ​​ ) ​ = α +  ​β 1 ​ ​​ ​ *p* ​ *t* *[v]* ​ ​ +  ​β 2 ​ ​​ ​τ ​ *vt*, *C ​O* 2 ​ *​* ​ ​​ +  ​β ​ 3 ​​ ​ *D* *t* ​, *C ​O* 2 ​ ​​ ​​ +  ​ *X* *t* ​ ​​ γ +  ​ϵ *t* ​ ​​​,

where ​​ *x* *t* ​ ​​​ is gasoline consumption per capita; ​​ *D* *t* ​, *C ​O* 2 ​ ​​​ is a dummy that takes the value ​​
of 1 for years from 1991 and onward and zero otherwise; ​​ *X* ​ *t* ​​​ is a vector of control
variables GDP per capita, urbanization, the unemployment rate, and a time trend;
and finally, ​​ϵ ​ *t* ​​​ is idiosyncratic shocks.
The results from the OLS regression of our ­log-linear model, columns 1–4 in
Table 3, show that the carbon tax elasticity is around 3.1–4.5 times larger than the
corresponding price elasticity, a difference that is statistically significant in all cases.
With a ­log-linear function, the estimated coefficients are typically referred to as
­semi-elasticities. Thus, using the results in column 4, we see that a one unit change
to the carbon tax or the ­tax-exclusive price is associated with a change in gasoline
consumption of 18.6 and 6 percent, respectively.
There is a risk, however, that the results are biased because of omitted variables,
anticipatory effects, or the endogeneity of gasoline prices: that gasoline consumption
affects the gasoline price and not just the other way around. Endogeneity is arguably
a lesser risk for a small country such as Sweden, compared with larger oil consumers
such as the United States, since crude oil prices are set in a global market and changes
in demand in Sweden will thus have a negligible impact on the world price. The issue
still needs to be addressed, though, since domestic producers (at the retail and refinery level) may adjust their margin, and hence affect the pump price, as a response to
local changes in demand. In columns 5 and 6 of Table 3, the carbon ­tax-exclusive gasoline price is instrumented using the energy tax rate and the (brent) crude oil price.
The energy tax rate makes up a large part of the carbon ­tax-exclusive price and thus
satisfies the instrument-relevance condition. At the same time, changes to the energy
tax level occur with a considerable lag and are often driven by exogenous changes
to environmental policies, and thus also satisfy the instrument exogeneity condition.
Taken together, the energy tax rate is arguably a valid instrument.
Comparing the estimated coefficients in column 4 with 5 and 6, we see that they
are almost identical; thus, endogeneity of gasoline prices is likely not a problem
in our model. Running the ­Durbin-Wu-Hausman test also indicates that the carbon ­tax-exclusive gasoline price is indeed exogenous to gasoline consumption.
Additionally, the Stock and Yogo (2005) test for weak instruments indicate that the

*Notes:* The dependent variable is the log of gasoline consumption per capita. The real carbon ­tax-exclusive price
of gasoline and the real carbon tax are measured in 2005 Swedish kronor. GDP per capita is measured in 2005
Swedish kronor (thousands). Urban population is measured as percentage of total population. Unemployment is
measured as percentage of total labor force. Columns 5 and 6 use the real energy tax and the brent crude oil price as
instrumental variables for the carbon ­tax-exclusive gasoline price. ­Newey-West standard errors are in parentheses;
heteroscedasticity and autocorrelation robust. Standard errors are calculated using 16 lags, chosen with the NeweyWest (1994) method.

energy tax is a weak instrument, but not the crude oil price. If we still believe that the
carbon ­tax-exclusive price is endogenous, we should use the results from column 6
that have the crude oil price as an instrument.
Anticipatory behavior—consumers increasing their purchases of transport fuel
before tax increases—may also bias the estimated price and carbon tax coefficients
(Coglianese et al. 2017). I included leads and lags in the regression to test for this,
however, and found no indication of a potential anticipatory effect; the estimated price
and carbon tax elasticities were very similar to the main regression result. Likely,
anticipatory behavior is a larger issue when dealing with monthly instead of yearly
data.

The earlier analysis of tax incidence in Section I indicated that tax changes are
fully passed through to consumers, and we can thus view the estimated elasticities
as demand elasticities. The results in column 4 of Table 3 give a price elasticity [17]
of demand of −0.51 and a carbon tax elasticity of demand of −1.57, a ratio in the

17 Elasticity of demand is given by ​ε = ( *dY* / *dX* )( *X* / *Y* ) ​, and our model is ­log linear: ​log( *Y* ) = *a* + *bX* ​, and
thus the elasticity is ​ε = *b* ​ *e* ​ ​ *[a]* [+] *[bX]* ​( *X* / *Y* ) = *bY* ( *X* / *Y* ) = *bX* ​. Here, ​ *X* ​ is the real price of gasoline at its sample

demand response of just over 3. The model specification I use is a static model; no
lags are included. Each observation of the outcome variable is hence modeled as
depending only on contemporaneous values of the explanatory variables. Elasticity
estimates using yearly data and a static model often fall ­in-between the short- and
­long-run elasticities found when using lagged models (Dahl and Sterner 1991) and
are therefore viewed as “intermediate.” Dahl and Sterner (1991) [18] reports an average intermediate price elasticity of demand for gasoline among OECD countries of

− −
0.53, so my estimate of 0.51 is in line with the previous literature.
Now, using the estimated tax and price ­semi-elasticities from column 4, we can
disentangle the effect of the carbon tax on emissions from the effect of the VAT,
applying a simulation approach: the difference between a scenario where no VAT
and no carbon tax is introduced and a scenario where either VAT or VAT and the

carbon tax is added to the price of gasoline. Since the energy tax is included in all
simulated scenarios, the effect of movements in the rate cancels itself out, thereby
keeping it constant.
The distance between the top (dashed) line and the middle ( ­dot-dashed) line in
Figure 13 measures the emission reductions attributable to the VAT. Similarly, the
distance between the middle line and the bottom (solid) line measures the emission
reductions attributable to the carbon tax. Up until the year 2000, the carbon tax and
the VAT are separately responsible for around half of the reduction in each year. In

−
2000, the carbon tax contributes to a 5.5 percent, or 0.15 metric tons per capita,
reduction in Swedish transport emissions. Between 2000–2005, the carbon tax is
increased, and consequently a larger and larger share of the emission reduction each
year is attributed to it. In 2005, around three-fourths of the total emission reduction

−
is due to the carbon tax, a 9.4 percent, or 0.27 metric tons per capita, reduction in
transport emissions. [19]

In an average year during 1990–2000, the carbon tax contributed to emission

−
reductions of 4.8 percent, or 0.13 metric tons per capita. If we look at the entire
­posttreatment period of 1990–2005, the carbon tax resulted in emission reductions

−
of 6.3 percent, or 0.17 metric tons per capita in an average year.
Now, comparing directly the emission reductions we find using the simulation
approach (Figure 13) with the earlier results from our empirical analysis (Figure 5),
we will get an estimate of the effect on emissions from the increase in the carbon tax rate in the years 2001–2005, had the energy tax rate not been simultaneously decreased. The two estimates in Figure 14 track each other quite closely from
­­1990–2000, before diverging in the subsequent years. In 2005, the estimated emission reduction is more than twice as large when using simulation compared with the
results using the synthetic control method: −0.757 to −0.355. The big difference
in 2005 is due to the real carbon tax rate increasing by almost 130 percent from

mean: 8.48 SEK. The price elasticity of demand is hence given by ​−0.0603 × 8.48 = −0.51 ​ and the carbon tax
elasticity: ​−0.186 × 8.48 = −1.57 ​.
18 The Dahl and Sterner (1991) paper takes the average from 22 studies—that all use yearly ­time-series data—of
the intermediate price elasticity of demand for gasoline across different OECD countries. Seventeen out of the 22
estimates are for European countries, most commonly France and Germany, but studies for Sweden are also included.
19 Here, I am still using the total estimated emission reductions that we found using the synthetic control
method. In 2005, three-fourths of the total emission reduction is attributable to the carbon tax, which gives an
emission reduction of ​0.75 × (−0.35) = −0.27 ​ metric tons due to the carbon tax.

*Notes:* The top (dashed) line shows predicted emissions when the carbon tax elasticity is set to zero, and the VAT

included. The bottom (solid) line gives predicted emissions using the full model with the differentiated tax and

­2000–2005. The synthetic control method thus gives us an estimate of the actual
emission reductions attributable to the introduction of VAT and the carbon tax in
­1990–1991 and the subsequent changes in the carbon and energy tax rates between
1991–2005. The simulation exercise further tells us what the possible emission
reductions from the carbon tax had been if policymakers in Sweden kept the (real)
energy tax level constant between 2000–2005.

**V. Discussion**

My results can be compared with previous analyses of the Swedish carbon tax.
In Bohlin (1998), the author concludes that during ­1990–1995 the carbon tax had
no effect on emissions from the transport sector. I instead find an average emission
reduction of 3.6 percent during ­1990–1995 attributed to the carbon tax with a reduction in 1995 alone of 5.8 percent. Bohlin (1998, 283) states that he doesn’t use a
modeling approach and instead relies on ­ex post data, but other than “using criteria
developed by OECD in 1997” we are not given any detail on the methodology used
to, for instance, derive the counterfactual emission levels. It is thus hard to determine why our estimates differ.

Figure 14. Gap in Per Capita CO ​​ ​ ​ 2 ​​​ Emissions from Transport: Synthetic Control versus Simulation

*Notes:* The shaded area highlights the period between 2000–2005 when the carbon tax rate was more than doubled
(first tax increase in 2001).

Lin and Li (2011) adopts a DiD framework to estimate reductions in emission
growth rates due to carbon taxation in Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Norway, and the
Netherlands. They find a significant effect for Finland only, a 1.7 percent reduction
in the growth rate of CO ​​ ​ ​ 2 ​​​ per capita. There are, however, countries in their control group that are less than ideal when creating the counterfactual emissions, such
as Austria, Luxembourg, and Ireland. [20] Furthermore, they use total CO ​​ ​ ​ 2 ​​​ emissions
as their outcome variable and hence combine “treated” and “untreated” sectors of

the economies in their research design; all countries with carbon taxes have some
sectors that are exempted. [21] This approach violates one of the assumptions underlying causal inference and therefore does not provide a true estimate of the environmental efficiency of carbon taxes. [22] Lastly, some of their included covariates, such
as urbanization level, industry structure, and energy prices, are likely themselves
affected by the carbon tax and thus also outcome variables. Including them on the
right-hand side of their regression will thus bias the results.
Lastly, Sweden’s fifth national report on climate change (Ministry of the
Environment and Energy 2009) estimates that the reduction of CO ​​ ​ ​ 2 ​​​ emissions from
the transport sector in 2005 is 1.7 million metric tons compared with if Sweden
had kept taxes at the 1990 level—an important assumption since the tax level then

20 See Section IIA to why this is.
21 Bruvoll and Larsen (2004), which analyzes the effects of the Norwegian carbon tax, similarly combines
treated and untreated sectors.
22 Two underlying assumptions in analyses of causal effects are no interference between units, and all treated
units receive the same dose of the treatment.

already includes VAT. The emission reduction is simulated by estimating changes
in gasoline consumption, using price elasticities of demand. Their estimate is markedly lower than my empirical estimate, which shows a reduction in 2005 of 2.4
million metric tons of CO ​​ ​ ​ 2 ​​​ from the carbon tax. Besides assuming that the real gasoline tax stays constant at the 1990 level when calculating their counterfactual, they
apply a ( ­long-run) price elasticity of demand for gasoline of −0.8 (Edwards 2003),
based on an average from a number of European studies. That I find, using empirical
­ex post data, an estimate of the emission reduction in 2005 that is 40 percent larger

−
and a ­carbon-tax elasticity of 1.57, around twice the size of the price elasticity
they use, shows how simulation analyses may underestimate the effectiveness of
carbon taxes.
In addition to the the empirical finding that the Swedish carbon tax has been
envrionmentally efficient, this paper shows that Swedish consumers exhibit larger
behavioral responses to changes to the carbon tax rate compared with equivalent
changes to the carbon ­tax-exclusive gasoline price. This finding is similar to some
earlier studies of carbon and gasoline taxes (Davis and Kilian 2011; Li, Linn, and
Muehlegger 2014; Rivers and Schaufele 2015; and Antweiler and Gulati 2016). My
study is the first, however, to analyze a European market, whereas earlier studies
have focused on the United States and Canada, where gasoline taxes are significantly lower. In 2008, excise gasoline taxes in US cents per liter was 120 in Sweden
but only 32 in Canada and 13 in the United States (IEA 2019). As a percentage
of the overall gasoline price, excise taxes constitutes 61.6 percent in Sweden, but
only 27.5 percent in Canada, and 14.6 percent in the United States. Consequently,
the ­tax-inclusive gasoline price is much less volatile in Sweden than in the United
States and Canada, since the stable and certain part, the excise taxes, make up a
larger part of the whole. Because of large differences in consumer prices for gasoline, a, say, 10 cent increase in gasoline taxes will create larger price increases (in
percentage terms) in the United States and Canada than in Sweden, and thus larger
relative reductions in consumption—assuming tax elasticities are similar across
the three countries. Therefore, one should be careful regarding the external validity
of the estimated emission reductions found in this paper. A Swedish-sized carbon
tax rate applied to ­low-tax level countries will most likely lead to larger emission
reductions than what is found in this paper. Nevertheless, countries that are similar
to Sweden will likely experience comparable emission reductions from the same
level of carbon tax. What is important here, though, is the term “similar” countries.
Important predictors of emissions, such as level of GDP, degree of urbanization,
and prior level of fuel taxes, are variables to take into account when considering the
external validity of the results.
In summary, earlier studies of the environmental efficiency of carbon taxes have
had issues with constructing a credible counterfactual, either by including countries
in the donor pool that are themselves treated or including countries that are too dissimilar when it comes to important predictors of CO ​​ ​ ​ 2 ​​​ emissions; combining emissions from treated and untreated sectors of the economy in their outcome variable;
the choice of control variables—including “bad controls”; using price elasticities
of demand that underestimate the environmental efficiency of carbon taxes; and not
capturing substitutions between different transport fuels or between different modes

of transport. The ­take-home message is thus to think hard about research design (as
always) and how to find a suitable identification strategy. Using ­ex post empirical
data on emissions and important predictors of it, together with the synthetic control
method, allowed me to capture all possible substitutions made and to recognize
those control units that were most suitable for this comparative case study, and ultimately identify the causal effect of the Swedish carbon tax on emissions.

**VI. Conclusion**

The Paris Agreement is rightly seen as an important step taken toward the common goal of addressing climate change. To reach the mitigation targets put forward
by each country, it is important to rely on environmentally and economically efficient measures such as carbon pricing.
This paper shows empirically that a carbon tax can be successful in significantly
reducing emissions of carbon dioxide. After implementation of a carbon tax and VAT
on transport fuels in Sweden, CO ​​ ​ ​ 2 ​​​ emissions from transport declined almost 11 percent in an average year, with 6 percent from the carbon tax alone. This result is in
contrast to earlier empirical studies that find little to no effect on emissions from carbon taxes. The identification strategy adopted is to carefully construct a control unit
that did not implement a carbon tax, or similar policies, but had a similar level and
trajectory of CO ​​ ​ ​ 2 ​​​ emissions before treatment. The control unit, synthetic Sweden, is
able to accurately reproduce the values for Sweden on a number of key predictors of
CO ​​ ​ ​ 2 ​​​ emissions from the transport sector, and to closely track emissions during the
30 years prior to treatment. Also, the use of empirical data on the outcome variable
allows us to capture substitutions made between transport fuels—most notably from
gasoline to diesel—as well as substitutions between modes of transport. This is an
improvement upon simulation studies that use changes in gasoline consumption as
a proxy for total changes in CO ​​ ​ ​ 2 ​​​ emissions from transport. The results obtained are
furthermore robust to a series of placebo tests. Reassigning the treatment at random
in the sample shows that the probability of obtaining a ­posttreatment result as large
as that for Sweden is just 0.067.
Lastly, this paper finds that consumers respond more strongly to changes to the
carbon tax rate than equivalent ­market-driven gasoline price changes. The estimated carbon tax elasticity of demand for gasoline is three times larger than the
price elasticity. This finding has implications for climate change policies in that
carbon taxes would be more effective in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and
air pollution than previous simulation studies suggests. Future analyses of the
economics of climate change thus ought to take into consideration the finding that
consumers’ response to carbon taxes may be larger than existing estimates of price
elasticities of demand indicate.
