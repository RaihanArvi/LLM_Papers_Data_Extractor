## CARBON TAX POLICY  [‡]
# Measuring the Macroeconomic Impact of Carbon Taxes [†]
### By Gilbert E. Metcalf and James H. Stock*


Economists have long argued that a carbon tax
is a cost-effective way to reduce greenhouse gas
emissions. Increasingly, members of Congress
agree. In 2019, seven carbon tax bills were filed
in Congress (Kaufman et al. 2019). In addition,
the Climate Leadership Council has built bipartisan support for a carbon tax and dividend plan
(Baker et al. 2017).
In contrast, the Trump administration is
retreating from any climate policy and has taken
steps to withdraw from the Paris Accord, citing heavy economic costs to the US economy
from meeting the US commitments made during
the Obama administration. In his June 1, 2017,
statement on the accord, for example, the president claimed that the cost to the economy would
be “close to three trillion dollars in lost GDP and
6.5 million industrial jobs” (Trump 2017).
What is the basis for claims about the economic impact of a carbon tax? Economic impacts
of a carbon tax typically are estimated using
computable general equilibrium (CGE) models (as was done for the report on which Trump
based his claims). These models, while helpful,
make many simplifying assumptions to remain
tractable, including optimization, representative
agents, and simplified expectations and dynamics, so at a minimum those estimates would

­ideally be complemented by empirical evidence
on the macroeconomic effects of carbon taxes in
practice. With carbon taxes in place in 25 countries around the world, including some dating to
the early 1990s, empirical analysis of historical
experience is now possible. This paper considers
carbon taxes in Europe to estimate their impact
on GDP and employment. [1]

**I. Previous Literature**

Most analyses of the economic impact of carbon taxes rely on large-scale CGE models. One
representative model is the E3 model described
in Goulder and Hafstead (2017). They estimate
that a $40 per ton carbon tax starting in 2020 and
rising at 5 percent real annually would reduce
GDP by just over 1 percent in 2035. While different models give different results, most find
very modest reductions (if at all) in GDP from
implementing a carbon tax. [2] [,] [3] But these are
modeling results. With nearly 30 years of data

1 This paper does not focus on the emission reduction
impacts of a carbon tax. Metcalf (2019) surveys that literature. A more recent paper by Andersson (2019) finds that the
Swedish carbon tax reduced transport emissions by 6 percent, a result that is 3 times the size of the emissions reduction implied by gasoline price elasticities. He argues that this
may be an underestimate of the emission reduction potential
in other countries due to the high rate of existing excise taxation on fuels in Sweden relative to other countries.
2 Trump cited a NERA study (Bernstein et al. 2017) commissioned by an industry group to analyze how meeting an
80 percent reduction by 2050 would affect various industry sectors. Among other issues, the headline number cited
by Trump (7 percent reduction in GDP) is from a NERA
scenario in which sector-specific regulations are imposed
with very different marginal abatement costs across sectors.
If marginal abatement costs are allowed to equalize across
sectors, the costs are reduced by over two-thirds.
3 Goulder et al. (2019) also considers a tax starting at $40
per ton and rising at 2 percent annually. They find the GDP
costs over the 2016–2050 period discounted at 3 percent
equal to less than one-third of one percent of GDP.

from countries that have implemented carbon
taxes, now is an opportune time to look at the
empirical evidence.
Metcalf (2019) summarizes the rather thin
empirical literature on the economic effects of
carbon taxes. Much of that literature focuses
on the tax’s impact on emissions. Focusing
on GDP, Metcalf (2019) finds no adverse
GDP impact of the British Columbia carbon
tax based on a difference-in-difference (DID)
analysis of a panel of Canadian provinces over
the time period 1990–2016. Using a panel of
European countries over the time period 1985–
2017, he finds, if anything, a modest positive
impact on GDP. That imposing a carbon tax
might have positive impacts on GDP is not
implausible once one considers the governments’ use of carbon tax revenue. In the early
1990s, for example, carbon taxes were imposed
in a number of Scandinavian countries as a revenue source to finance reductions in marginal
tax rates for their income taxes (see Brännlund
and Gren 1999 for background on these
reforms).
The paper by Bernard, Kichian, and Islam
(2018) is closest in spirit to this paper. It uses
a VAR framework to estimate the impact of the
British Columbia carbon tax on provincial GDP.
It finds no impact of the tax on GDP. Yamazaki
(2017) looked at the employment effects of the
British Columbia carbon tax and found modest
positive impacts on employment in the province.
While aggregate impacts were small, he found
significant job shifting from carbon-intensive to
noncarbon-intensive sectors.

**II. Our Analysis**

Our aim is to estimate the dynamic effect
of a carbon tax on the growth rate of GDP and
employment. [4] Our sample includes 31 European
countries (“EU+ countries”) that all are part
of the EU Emission Trading System (ETS), a

4 Standard public finance theory as embodied in CGE
models suggests a relation between the level of the tax and
the level of GDP. Over a given period, an adjustment of GDP
from a no-tax to a tax path entails a shift in the level, that is,
an effect on the growth rate. Our analysis focuses on a short
horizon, six years, so a transition to a lower GDP growth
path would appear as a lower rate of GDP growth over this
transition, relative to a no-tax counterfactual. Focusing on
growth effects has the benefit of not needing to model trends
in GDP and carbon tax data.


cap-and-trade system to reduce emissions in
the electricity and certain energy-intensive sectors. [5] This includes EU countries plus Iceland,
Norway, and Switzerland. Of these 31 countries,
15 have a carbon tax on some sector of the economy. Our data on real GDP and carbon tax rates
come from the World Bank Group (2019); the
latter data are from a new dataset made available
by the World Bank and published on their website’s Carbon Pricing Dashboard. [6] Employment
data are from the EU Eurostat database. Data
on the share of emissions covered by the tax
come from a new dataset made available by the
World Bank Group (2019), and energy price and
energy excise tax data are from the International
Energy Agency (2019).
Attributing aggregate growth effects to a carbon tax is complicated by the multiplicity of
macroeconomic shocks affecting these countries, the substantial measurement error in GDP
growth, and the simultaneous existence of the
ETS. Most countries have enacted carbon taxes
to cover emissions not covered by the carbon tax
(e.g., residential and commercial heating and
transport [7] ). Some countries, most notably the
United Kingdom, tax certain sectors covered by
the ETS. The United Kingdom taxes electricity
only to the extent that it brings the emissions
price up to a floor consistent with its Climate
Change Levy.
We focus on EU+ countries to control consistently for the impact of the ETS on growth.
The ETS went into effect with a pilot phase
(phase I) in 2005. In phase I, power stations and

5 See Schmalensee and Stavins (2017) for an overview
of the EU ETS.
6 Real carbon tax rates are nominal tax rates divided by
the GDP deflator (home country currency), converted to
US dollars at 2018 exchange rates. We used national statistical agency data for GDP and prices, instead of World
Bank data, for Ireland and Norway. For Ireland, we used
adjusted gross national income, which eliminates distortions
from intellectual property inflows due to Ireland’s status as
a tax haven (Worstall 2016), and the CPI. Norway maintains
dual accounts, onshore and offshore, the latter including
oil revenues; we use onshore GDP and its deflator to avoid
spuriously confounding carbon tax effects with Norway’s
offshore oil production. We are grateful to Celine Ramstein
of the World Bank for providing early access to the carbon
tax dataset.
7 Emissions from oil refining are subject to the ETS but
not the burning of fuels in transportation. Oil refining emissions accounts for less than 10 percent of well-to-wheel
emissions.

certain energy-intensive sectors were subject to
the cap. [8] Phase II (2008–2012) added domestic
aviation (in 2012), and phase III (2013–2020)
added various additional sectors. [9]

Table 1 lists the countries with carbon taxes
(chronologically by year of implementation)
along with their tax rate in 2018 and the share of
emissions covered by the tax. There is variation
both in tax rates (across and within countries)
and the year of implementation of the tax.

A. *Econometric Model*

The essential challenge of identifying the
dynamic causal effect of a carbon tax on GDP
growth is the possibility of simultaneity: poor
economic outcomes could lead the tax authorities to reduce the rate or to postpone a planned
increase, or alternatively a tax could be imposed
when the economy is booming and policymakers and the public feel they can afford the tax.
In this regard, it is useful to think of changes
to a carbon tax as having two components—
one responding to historical economic growth,
the other being unpredicted by past growth.
Changes in the latter category could include tax
changes based on historically legislated schedules, changes in ambition based on the environmental preferences of the party in power, or
responses to international climate policy pressure. Our identifying assumption is that this
latter category of changes—those not predicted
by historical own-country GDP growth and current and past international economic shocks—
are exogenous. This assumption allows us to
estimate the dynamic effect on GDP growth
of the unexpected component of a carbon tax
using the Jordà (2005) local projection (LP)
method, adapted to panel data. Specifically, we

8 The sectors are power stations and other combustion
plants of at least 20 megawatts, oil refineries, coke ovens,
iron and steel plants, cement clinker, glass, lime, bricks,
ceramics, pulp, and paper and board. Aluminum; petrochemicals; ammonia; nitric, adipic, and glyoxylic acid production; and CO 2 capture, transport, and storage were added
in phase III.
9 Twenty-five of the 31 countries in our sample have been
subject to the ETS from its inception. Romania and Bulgaria
joined in 2007, while Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein
joined the ETS starting with phase II in 2008. Croatia joined
the ETS as of phase III in 2013. See European Commission
(2015) for a history and membership of the ETS.

denotes control variables, which in our base
specification are year effects. Standard errors
are heteroskedasticity robust (Plagborg-Møller
and Wolf 2019). Depending on the sample of
countries, our primary results use either the carbon tax rate or the tax rate interacted with its
2019 share of its emission coverage. [10] The latter
specification assumes that any damage (or benefit) of the tax to an economy would be, in the
first instance, proportional to the covered share
of the economy.
A stronger identification condition is that the
carbon tax is strictly exogenous, that is, there is
no feedback from GDP growth to the tax rate.

10 Data on emissions coverage are only available for 2019
in the World Bank dataset.

This no-feedback condition is not rejected at the
10 percent level in any of the base specifications.
Imposing this condition permits estimating the
dynamic response using a distributed lag (DL;
current plus six lags) of the carbon tax and year
effects based on the following equation:

The identification assumption for this regression is that politicians do not respond to changes
in domestic economic conditions by adjusting
the carbon tax. This identifying assumption,
while not rejected empirically, is less compelling than that underlying the LP specification
(1).

B. *Results*

Rather than report estimated coefficients, we
report in Table 2 the estimated impacts from a
$40 per ton increase in the country’s tax rate,
computed as in Sims (1986), modified for LP.
For specifications in which the tax is interacted
with the share, results are presented for a $40
tax that covers 30 percent of emissions (close to
the sample mean). All regressions include year
effects to control for macroeconomic shocks
common to all countries in a given year, such
as oil prices and the global financial crisis. The
DL regressions just include lags of the tax rate
in a given country, while the LP regressions also
control for own-country GDP (or employment)
growth rates.
Panel A of Table 2 presents results for four different regressions. We report results from the LP
and DL specification applied to the entire EU+
set of countries and to those countries that have
a carbon tax rate of at least $20 per ton (in 2018
dollars) in at least one year. The latter 11-country
sample addresses the possibility that our results in
the full sample are driven by the handful of countries with very low carbon tax rates.
The first row of Table 2 reports results from
the DL regression on the entire sample. [11] The
immediate impact of the enactment of the $40
per ton carbon tax is to boost the growth rate by
0.1 percentage points. The impact is imprecisely

11 For this and all other regressions on the full sample,
we interact the tax rate with the share of emissions covered
by the tax in 2019. We do not interact the rate with the share
in the regressions limited to rates greater than $20 per ton.

DL, heteroskedasticity robust for LP). Estimation method is

of countries with a carbon tax rate of at least $20 in at least

second years following enactment of the tax is
0.48 percentage points. The impact for years
three through five falls to 0.38. None of these
impacts are statistically significant at the 10 percent level. [12]

The next reported regression (row 2) is based
on the LP method and assumes the weaker
exogeneity conditions of that model. The point
estimates continue to be positive but are not
statistically significant. The immediate growth
impact of the carbon tax is now 0.26 percentage points, rises to 0.53 points for years one
and two, and then declines to 0.38 percentage
points in the subsequent three years. These

regressions suggest a modest positive growth
impact from the carbon tax, but given the
­standard errors, we cannot reject a zero impact.
More importantly, the results do not support a
­conclusion that the carbon tax adversely impacts
GDP growth rates.
One concern may be that we are mixing
countries with substantial carbon tax rates with
those with very low taxes on carbon emissions.
Poland, for example, has a tax rate in 2018 of
$0.16 per ton; its rate in previous years is of the
same order of magnitude. The next two sets of
results limit our attention to those 11 countries
with tax rates of at least $20 in one year. The
estimated impacts continue to be positive but
statistically imprecise. The immediate impacts
are larger than in the full sample but lower in
following years. Again, there is no evidence supporting a claim of adverse impacts on growth.
These four sets of regressions are consistent in
showing positive, albeit imprecisely estimated,
impacts of the carbon tax on GDP growth rates.
While the positive point estimates are intriguing, the more important result is the absence of
support for the claim that European carbon taxes
have adversely impacted economic growth in
those countries imposing carbon taxes.
Table 2, panel B reports results from a similar
set of regressions on total employment growth
rates. As in panel A, the estimated impacts of
the carbon tax on employment growth rates are
positive both immediately and up to five years
following implementation. The one exception is
the impact in years three to five in the full-sample LP regression where we report a negative
impact of 0.08 percentage points (standard

=
error 0.21 pp). Limiting our attention to the
11 countries with tax rates of at least $20, we
find larger positive impacts in all cases. In fact,
the immediate impact on employment in the LP
regression of 0.83 percentage points is statistically significant at the 5 percent level, a result
consistent with Yamazaki’s (2017) finding for
British Columbia. Again, however, we think the
major takeaway from these results is the lack
of evidence for the claim of adverse macroeconomic impacts from a carbon tax.
One concern with our methodology is that we
are not controlling for trade interactions within
the EU+ set of countries. A common concern
with any carbon pricing scheme is that it leads
to leakage, whereby emission reductions in a
country enacting climate policy simply lead to


increased emissions in another country. [13] The
leakage concern here is that if one country, say
Germany, enacts a carbon tax, then emission-intensive manufacturing moves from Germany to
a nearby country that does not have a carbon
tax. Leakage is certainly a possibility, and we
do not explicitly try to control for it. But any
leakage that might occur in the European Union
from country-specific carbon taxes arguably will
bias our results in a negative direction, that is, to
overstating the harm of a carbon tax, compared
to the effects of the tax under autarchy. This adds
force to our claim that our results do not support
claims of adverse macroeconomic impacts of a
carbon tax.

C. *Robustness*

The results presented in Table 2 are robust
to a wide range of model specifications and a
large number of sensitivity checks. We have also
estimated the dynamic impacts using an alternative measure of the tax (the logarithm of the
pump price of diesel relative to the price of diesel excluding the carbon tax component), using
GDP per capita instead of GDP, using OECD
and former Soviet Union growth rates and their
lags as controls instead of year effects, restricting the sample to only Scandinavian countries,
and dropping Ireland and Norway (so as to use
only World Bank GDP data). [14] In all the various specifications we tried, we find results that
are qualitatively the same as the results shown
in Table 2.

D. *Discussion*

This paper presents the first comprehensive
evidence on the macroeconomic impacts of

13 Baylis, Fullerton, and Karney (2013) describes various
forms of leakage that can arise with climate policy.
14 In the World Bank data (and in unadjusted Ireland
national accounts), Ireland’s GDP rose by 26 percent in
2015 due to Apple shifting its intellectual property to Ireland
(Worstall 2016). Ireland reports an alternative set of national
accounting data that removes the investment distortions arising from Ireland’s status as an attractive tax haven, and we
use these alternative data for Ireland in this study. We also
deviate from the World Bank GDP data by using so-called
onshore GDP for Norway, an alternative set of data maintained by Statistics Norway that exclude the North Sea oil
activity. These latter accounts better reflect the state of the
Norwegian economy.

European carbon taxes on GDP and ­employment
growth rates. Using a new dataset from the
World Bank on carbon prices around the world,
we find that typically the carbon tax has positive effects on GDP growth and employment.
The positive effects are occasionally statistically significant but generally are not, so that
the estimated growth effects are consistent with
no effect of the tax on the growth rates of GDP
or employment. More importantly, we find no
robust evidence of a negative effect of the tax on
employment or GDP growth. For the European
experience, at least, we find no support for the
view that carbon taxes are job or growth killers.
