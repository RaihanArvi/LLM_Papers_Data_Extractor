1. Introduction

#### a b s t r a c t

Energy efficiency in the residential housing market can play an important role in the
reduction of global carbon emissions. This paper reports the first evidence on the
market adoption and economic implications of energy performance certificates implemented by the European Union. The results show that adoption rates are low and
declining over time, coinciding with a negative sentiment regarding the label in the
popular media. Labels are clustered among smaller, post-war homes in neighborhoods
with more difficult selling conditions. We also document that geographic variation in
the adoption rate of energy labels is positively related to the fraction of ‘‘green’’ voters
during the 2006 national elections. Within the sample of labeled homes, the energy
label creates transparency in the energy efficiency of dwellings. Our analysis shows that
consumers capitalize this information into the price of their prospective homes.

The current focus on carbon abatement has lead to increased attention on energy efficiency in the built environment,
which offers substantial opportunities for the reduction of greenhouse gasses [12,28]. Although building codes have
generally been mildly effective in reducing energy consumption [3,18], globally policy makers target the real estate sector
with stricter energy-efficiency standards and mandates. For instance, the European Union implemented the Energy
Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) in January 2003 with the explicit goal of promoting energy performance
improvements in buildings. The Directive, which was recently recast, includes an explicit element on the disclosure of
energy performance in buildings: ‘‘yMember states shall ensure that, when buildings are constructed, sold or rented out,
an energy performance certificate is made available to the owner or by the owner to the prospective buyer or tenant.’’ [1] The
Directive has lead to the implementation of national Energy Performance Certificates (EPCs) for residential dwellings as
well as utility buildings (e.g., office, retail, schools, and healthcare facilities) across the European Union.
The introduction of energy labels can be viewed as an additional step to enhance the transparency of energy
consumption in the real estate sector. Greater transparency may enable private and corporate occupiers to take energy

efficiency into account when making housing decisions. Recent evidence shows that providing feedback to private
consumers with respect to their energy consumption is an effective ‘‘nudge’’ to improve energy efficiency [4,8]. From an
economic perspective, the energy label could have financial utility for both real estate investors and tenants, as the energy
savings resulting from more efficient building may result in lower operating costs and higher property values.
However, evidence regarding the implementation and valuation of energy labels is limited, the diffusion and uptake of
energy labels across Europe has been slow, and private consumers are uncertain about the value represented by labels that
indicate some level of modeled energy efficiency.
This paper is the first to empirically address the implementation of energy labels under a large-scale certification
program in the European Union. Using a standardized measure to reflect the thermal efficiency of a structure, we study the
determinants of the adoption of energy performance certificates and the consequent economic implications in the
residential housing market. We use the Netherlands as a laboratory, as energy performance certification for homes was
introduced in the Netherlands in January 2008, one year before the official introduction date prescribed by the European
Union. Energy conservation is presumably quite important for Dutch residents, as the average energy bill of a Dutch
household was h152 per month in 2009 (h53 for electricity and h99 for gas), ranging from h105 for the most energy
efficient homes to h231 for the least energy efficient homes. For some households, energy costs represent almost half of
the total monthly housing expense.
Energy performance certification is not fully mandatory in the Netherlands: homebuyers are allowed to sign a waiver
that obviates the seller’s obligation to certify the dwelling. Based on some 177,000 housing transactions from January 2008
through August 2009, we find that during the first three months of 2008, more than 25 percent of all housing transactions
had an energy label. Soon after, the adoption rate of energy labels started to decline, eventually reaching an adoption rate
of less than seven percent of the 150,000 homes that were for sale as of September 2009. This sharp decrease in the
adoption rate coincides with a negative sentiment created by the main bodies in the real estate industry, such as the
Association of Realtors and the Association of Homeowners. Our ‘‘News Index,’’ based on counts of negative or positive
reporting on the energy label in the popular press, leads the energy label adoption curve by some three months.
Our empirical results show that the choice of certification is also determined by the quality of a dwelling. We find that
more heterogeneous homes, constructed post-war and during the seventies and eighties, located in high-density and lowincome areas are significantly more likely to obtain an energy label. The thermal characteristics of a dwelling, like
insulation and the heating system, do not influence the certification decision. Our results also provide some indication of
ideology as an explanation for the adoption of energy labels: adoption rates are higher among homeowners that voted for
‘‘green’’ political parties during the 2006 national elections.
We then turn to the market implications of the energy label. The label seems to fulfill its informational role and has a
moderately powerful market signal. We track the transaction process of some 32,000 labeled homes and document a
positive relation between the energy efficiency of a dwelling and its transaction price. Using the Heckman [17] two-step
method, we find that homes with a ‘‘green’’ label sell at a premium of 3.6 percent relative to otherwise comparable
dwellings with non-green labels. This transaction premium varies with the outcome of the label, and calculations indicate
that this variation can be partially explained by the underlying energy consumption of the dwelling.
This paper contributes to the early literature on the capitalization of thermal efficiency in residential dwellings

[9,14,22]. It also contributes to a more recent, growing literature on the economic implications of energy efficiency and
sustainability labels in the real estate sector, which has thus far predominantly addressed the commercial property market

[10,11,13]. The paper also relates to the fast-growing literature on environmentalism and consumer choice [16,19] that
increasingly focuses on residential energy consumption [7,8]. For policy makers, the results of this paper may shed light on
the main assumption underlying the widespread implementation of energy rating systems: the ability of the market to
capitalize energy efficiency in investment decisions. It may also help to further refine energy performance certification
programs and stimulate increased market demand for energy labels.
The next section of this paper is a brief review of the literature on energy efficiency in the built environment. Section 3
discusses the various programs of energy performance certification in the real estate sector and provides more details on
the European energy performance certification program. Section 4 describes the data and provides descriptive statistics.
Section 5 discusses the empirical results and Section 6 concludes.

2. Related literature

Models attempting to predict future residential energy consumption not only take the housing stock and its projected
growth into account, but also demographic, social, and behavioral characteristics of the occupants [5,20]. To ultimately
reduce the carbon footprint of the real estate sector, demand from occupiers and investors for more energy-efficient real
estate is necessary. Glaeser and Kahn [15] argue that if the carbon externality were appropriately priced, costs per
household would range from $830 to $1410 per year, depending on the climatic conditions and, more importantly, on a
city’s population and density. However, the early literature as well as more recent studies both show that households do
not directly take carbon emissions into account in relocation decisions, but rather focus on environmental externalities,
like pollution, traffic, and the availability of nature [1,6,16,25].
There are a handful of papers that explicitly address the willingness to pay for energy efficiency in residential dwellings.
Lacquatra [22] studies a small sample of newly constructed homes and documents that the Thermal Integrity Factor (TIF),

a proxy for energy efficiency, has a positive relation to the transaction price. Dinan and Miranowski [9] find a similar
relation between standardized energy consumption and prices of homes transacted in Des Moines, Iowa. In fact the
documented relation is quite precise: one dollar of energy savings leads to a $11.63 increase in the transaction price.
Gilmer [14] applies energy labels to a model of economic search and documents that benefits of labels are positive but
modest, i.e., energy labels shorten the search process.
More recently, evidence on the willingness to pay for energy efficiency in the real estate sector has mostly focused on
the commercial real estate sector. In a series of papers that study investor and tenant demand for ‘‘green’’ office space in
the U.S. office market, Eichholtz et al. [10,11] show that buildings with an Energy Star label – indicating that a building
belongs to the top 25 percent of the most energy-efficient buildings – have rents that are two to three percent higher as
compared to regular office buildings. Transaction prices for energy-efficient office buildings are higher by 13–16 percent.
Further analyses show that the cross-sectional variation in these premiums has a strong relation to real energy
consumption, indicating that tenants and investors in the commercial property sector capitalize energy savings in their
investment decisions.

To improve the energy performance of the built environment, building codes have become more stringent over the past
decades and construction standards have improved. These mostly supply-side measures have lead to substantial energy
savings [3,27]. However, other studies have documented a stagnating trend in the energy efficiency of buildings in
Western economies. N¨asse´n et al., [24] find that energy price elasticity has decreased over time, mainly due to a lack of
understanding of the life cycle cost – or, the economic payoff – following investments in energy efficiency. This is in line
with Kempton and Layne [21], who show that inefficient allocation of data on energy consumption restricts the energy
savings behavior of consumers. Also, there is documentation that deficiencies in public policies regarding energy
efficiency, limited regulation, and the conservatism in the building industry are to blame for the slow implementation
of energy efficiency measures [26].
Increased information transparency in energy consumption can be instrumental as a ‘‘nudge’’ to encourage energy
conservation among private consumers. Some recent experiments show that providing feedback to consumers on energy
consumption can substantially reduce energy bills [4], although political ideology seems to be an important moderating
factor [8]. Standardized energy performance certification programs can provide a cheap alternative to these small-scale
experiments, but these programs for energy ratings rest on the assumption that the residential housing market can
effectively incorporate information on thermal efficiency.

3. Energy performance certification and the EPBD

Various national governments have initiated rating systems that measure the extent to which both residential
dwellings and commercial buildings adhere to energy efficiency standards. The Energy Star program, a joint initiative by
the U.S. Department of Energy and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, is a long-running and notable example.
Residential buildings can receive an Energy Star certification if they are at least 15 percent more energy efficient than
homes built to the 2004 International Residential Code (IRC) and include additional energy-saving features that typically
make them 20–30 percent more efficient than standard homes. For consumers, there should be a clear relation between
investments in energy efficiency and the consequent savings, as stated by the EPA: ‘‘yenergy efficiency improvements

—
save homeowners money about $200–$400 per year on utility bills. More importantly, monthly energy savings can easily
exceed any additional mortgage cost for the energy efficiency improvements, resulting in a positive cash-flow from the
first day of home ownership.’’ [2] To date, close to a million dwellings have earned an Energy Star label.
Although numerous countries have introduced comparable initiatives to raise consumer awareness of energy
consumption and carbon emissions resulting from their homes, until recently, none have had the scope of the Energy
Star program. This changed in December 2002, when the European Parliament ratified Directive 2002/91/EC on the energy
performance of buildings, which makes energy performance disclosure mandatory for all member states. The Directive
argues that ‘‘a common approach [y] will contribute to a level playing field as regards efforts made in member states to
save energy in the buildings sector and will introduce transparency for prospective owners or users with regard to the
energy performance in the Community property market.’’ [3] This Directive mandates the introduction of comparable Energy
Performance Certificates (EPCs) across the European Union. The Directive should have been formally implemented in
January 2006 but member states were given an additional period of three years to fully adhere to the certification
procedures, due to the lack of qualified and/or accredited experts. The recast of the Directive in 2009 expanded the existing
legislation: the certificate now has to be included in all advertisements for selling or renting properties. Moreover, the
certificate and its energy saving recommendations have to be part of the documentation accompanying a rental or sales
transaction.

The European energy label has a common base across all member states and is derived from the thermal quality of the
dwelling. It takes elements such as insulation quality, heating installation, (natural) ventilation and indoor air climate,
solar systems, and built-in lighting into account. The certificate contains a simple universal indicator of the energy

consumption – the energy index – based on modeled primary energy consumption under average conditions. [4] Based on the
energy index, the energy performance certificate ranges from ‘‘Aþþ,’’ for exceptionally energy-efficient dwellings, to ‘‘G’’
for highly inefficient dwellings. Besides an energy-efficiency score, the certificate also contains specific advice on how to
improve the thermal performance of a building. Appendix A provides an example.
Professionally trained surveyors issue the certificates, with model inputs based on a physical inspection of the dwelling.
The certificate is valid for 10 years and requires an investment of some h200, which is incurred by the seller of the building.
Dwellings that have been constructed after 1999, or that have been officially registered as monuments, are exempt from
mandatory disclosure of an energy performance certificate. Importantly, if the buyer of a dwelling signs a waiver, the seller
is also exempt from providing the certificate at the time of the transaction.
The energy performance certificate offers a variety of benefits to private consumers. The certificate increases the
transparency in the energy consumption of a specific dwelling and results in EU-wide recognition of investments in energy
conservation. This recognition not only assures homeowners that energy-efficiency investments are recognized at the time
of sale, but it may also lead to a lower cost of funding through more favorable mortgage terms for energy-efficient homes.
An energy label may also shorten the economic search process by disclosing information to prospective homeowners [14].
This may be important in the opaque market for housing transactions. [5]

However, poorly defined label requirements and insufficient training of official certification agencies have characterized the recent introduction of energy performance certificates across the European Union. Also, the possibility of signing a
waiver has allowed private consumers to circumvent the mandatory disclosure of energy performance certificates in
housing transactions. In addition, industry bodies have openly questioned the reliability of the information provided by
energy labels and the need for providing such information to consumers. The combination of these factors has lead to a
slow implementation of energy labels across European residential housing markets and may affect the economic value of
energy performance certificates in the market place.
In the remainder of this paper, we empirically address the patterns and determinants of label adoption, and the
effectiveness of the energy label as a market signal. We use a large sample of housing transactions in the
Netherlands, which in January 2008 was one of the first EU member states to introduce energy performance
certificates.

4. Data

4.1. Data sources

Agentschap NL, an agency of the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs, exerts quality control and maintains registration
of the energy performance certificates in the Netherlands. We have access to the database of this organization, which
provides information on the energy performance rating, the address, and some physical building characteristics of all
buildings with an energy performance certificate. As of September 2009, more than 100,000 residential homes (rental and
owner-occupied) had been certified. [6]

To obtain information on housing transactions, we use the database of the Dutch Association of Realtors (NVM), which
includes information on the dwelling address, the characteristics of the transaction, and a wide array of quality
characteristics for each transacted dwelling. [7] As of September 2009, the NVM database contained 194,379 housing
transactions since the introduction of energy performance certificates in January 2008. [8]

For a slightly smaller subset of our sample, we are able to collect economic data on the neighborhood characteristics of
the home from the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS). We collect information on housing density, as measured by the
number of addresses within a one-kilometer radius, and on the average monthly household income, both for 2007. This
information is available at the zip code level. [9] As a proxy for local housing market conditions, we calculate the average
time on the market for homes transacted in 2006 and 2007, also at the zip code level.
To account for ideological heterogeneity of homeowners, we obtain voting data on the 2006 national elections
and calculate the percentage of votes for ‘‘green’’ parties. [10] The Netherlands has two political parties that distinctly
focus on animal rights and environmental conservation: the ‘‘Green Party’’ and the ‘‘Party for the Animals.’’

4 The primary energy consumption of a dwelling is modeled based on occupancy by an average household under normal climatic conditions. The
energy label thus provides an indication of energy consumption under standardized behavior and is not based on the actual energy consumption as
measured by energy bills.
5 There is a large body of literature that addresses the lack of information transparency in the residential housing market. See Levitt and Syverson

[23] for one example.
6 The sample of certified rental homes mostly consists of public housing owned by social housing corporations. As such, this sample is less suitable
for a study on energy labels and private market rents.
7 The members of the NVM collectively cover approximately 70 percent of all housing transactions in the Netherlands.
8 We only include transactions for which all data are available and for which the transaction price ranges between h10,000 and h10,000,000.
9 The zip code covers an area of less than a square mile around a home. Zip codes are of comparable size across our sample, and therefore a useful
proxy for the quality of the immediate neighborhood.
10 Data are obtained from http://www.verkiezingsuitslagen.nl.

The 2006 national elections had a turnout of more than 80 percent and are a proxy for the political balance at the
city level.

4.2. Descriptive statistics

We match the various data sets based on address information. Approximately, 18 percent of the transaction sample –
31,993 residential dwellings – has an energy performance certificate. However, these certified transactions are not evenly
distributed over the sample period. Fig. 1A presents the total number of transaction per month and the fraction of homes
transacted with an energy label. The number of housing transactions provides an indication for the dry-up of liquidity in
the housing market, with year-on-year transactions decreasing by some 35 percent. The graph also shows that the
fraction of rated homes strongly decreased during the sample period, starting at a label adoption rate of 25 percent in
January 2008 and decreasing to a label adoption rate of approximately 10 percent in the Summer of 2009. Anecdotally, we
can explain this remarkable drop in the adoption rate by the initial problems surrounding the implementation of the
energy label.
To more systematically address these initial problems, we assess the evolution of the public opinion regarding the
energy label by constructing a quantitative measure: the ‘‘News Index.’’ We use LexisNexis to collect all articles published
in the four major Dutch newspapers between January 2007 and August 2009, using a Boolean search on ‘‘energy label’’
and related terms. In line with Antweiler and Frank [2] and Tetlock [29], we convert these newspaper articles into a
numeric score by manually screening the articles on their sentiment regarding the energy label. Positive news receives a

score of 1, whereas negative news receives a score of –1. Front page news presumably has more impact and receives a
score of 2 or –2, respectively.

Fig. 1B shows the News Index for the period January 2007–August 2009. The popular media was generally positive on
the energy label in the run-up to the launch, but just before the official start of the labeling program, the Dutch Association
of Homeowners launched a media campaign asserting the lack of consistency and reliability of the energy performance
certification process. These critiques made headlines in the national press starting December 2007. During the Spring of
2008, several other important real estate bodies, including the Association of Realtors and the Association of Public
Housing Corporations, fueled the skepticism regarding the quality of the signal conveyed by the energy label and
questioned the need for an energy label in the housing market. This public dismay forced the Minister of Housing to admit
that the implementation of the certificate left something to be desired. Subsequent program improvements included
better training of certifying surveyors and enhancing the transparency of the labeling process. These advances were
implemented during the Fall of 2008, which favorably changed the public opinion on the energy label after January 2009.
The dynamics of the News Index are leading the adoption rate of the energy label in housing transactions. Simple
calculations show that the correlation is highest when the News Index is lagged by one quarter. Thus, public opinion and
media sentiment seem to be important determinants of the adoption rate of the energy performance certification program.
There is also substantial regional variation in the market penetration of energy labels. Fig. 2 shows labeled housing
transactions as a fraction of the total transaction volume for the 12 provinces in the Netherlands. The two main provinces
that form the economic core of the Netherlands (the so-called ‘‘Randstad’’), North-Holland, which includes Amsterdam,
and Utrecht, both have relatively low adoption rates of energy performance certificates. These rates are in contrast to the
high adoption rates in more distant provinces like Zeeland and Limburg.

Table 1 provides descriptive statistics on the physical characteristics of the labeled and non-labeled sample. Simple
comparisons show that labeled dwellings sell for slightly lower prices and are on the market six days longer, on average.
The dwelling type composition of the labeled sample is comparable to the composition of the sample of non-labeled
dwellings. There are some quality differences between labeled homes and non-labeled homes: the former are smaller by
about six square meters and are predominantly constructed between 1960 and 1990. Maintenance of the interior and

exterior and the insulation are of slightly lower quality as compared to the non-labeled transaction sample. The
neighborhood characteristics show that labeled dwellings are located in less dense areas with lower average household
incomes, and where homes are on the market longer.
Within the sample of labeled dwellings, about one third of the transactions has been awarded a ‘‘green’’
label—corresponding to a rating of A, B, or C. About a quarter of the certified homes have a D rating, where D indicates
that there is room for improvement in energy efficiency. Thirty-nine percent of the certified dwellings have a red label
(E or lower), which indicates that there are considerable opportunities to increase the energy performance of these
particular dwellings. Last, the economic downturn is clearly reflected in the distribution of the transactions over the
sample period: more than half of the transactions took place in the first two quarters of 2008, with transactions in the
housing market virtually grinding to a halt in the third quarter of 2009.

5. Method and results

5.1. The adoption process of energy performance certificates

To better understand the adoption process of energy performance certificates in the Dutch housing market, and to more
formally explore the determinants of label adoption, we estimate the following logit model:

p ¼ 1
### PrðEPCÞ i ¼ a þ b i X i þ d n L n þ r g c þ X l p p p þ e i ð1Þ

p

where EPC i is the binary variable with a value of one if transacted dwelling i has an energy performance certificate, and
zero otherwise. X i represents a vector of quality characteristics of a dwelling, such as size, age, and building quality. L n is a
vector of variables that reflect the neighborhood characteristics of each individual dwelling in cluster n; such as density,
average monthly household income, and the average time on the market. These variables are all at the zip code level and
vary per neighborhood n. g c is the fraction of votes for ‘‘green’’ parties during the 2006 national elections that varies per
city c. To further control for geographical effects, p i is the dummy variable with a value of one if a dwelling is located in
province p, and zero otherwise.

Table 2 presents the results of the logit estimation of Model (1). Results are provided for four different specifications. All
specifications include the News Index to control for time-variation in the adoption of energy labels, and province-fixed
effects to control for regional variation in the adoption rate. In the first Column, we include housing type, dwelling size and
the period of construction. Relative to detached dwellings (the default category), semi-detached dwellings, and especially
duplex dwellings are significantly more likely to have an energy performance certificate. In contrast, apartments are

significantly less likely to be labeled. The relative homogeneity of apartments as compared to other housing types may
decrease the need to disclose information about the thermal performance of the dwelling to the seller. The square footage

—
of a dwelling significantly decreases the likelihood of energy performance certification larger dwellings are less likely to
be labeled.

The period of construction has a distinct influence on the likelihood of energy performance certification. Relative to the
reference period, which consists of all dwellings constructed before 1930, only dwellings constructed after 2000 are
significantly less likely to be labeled. This is in line with the legislation regarding the certification process: dwellings that
have been constructed after 1999 are exempted from energy performance certification in the transaction process. The
coefficients further indicate that post-war homes and dwellings constructed between 1970 and 1990 are especially more
likely to be certified. Monuments are less likely to be certified (albeit insignificantly): current legislation does not require
an energy performance certificate for dwellings that have been awarded the official ‘‘monument’’ status.
Importantly, the coefficient on the lagged News Index has a significant and positive relation to the label adoption rate.
Thus, sentiment in the public media has a distinct influence on the likelihood of label adoption during the sample period.
In Column (2), we add thermal and quality characteristics of the dwelling to the model. It seems that the odds of label
adoption are not simply a reflection of the thermal characteristics of the dwelling. The presence of central heating and the
quality of insulation – two factors that are directly reflected in the modeled energy efficiency that determines the outcome
of the certification process – do not significantly increase the likelihood of energy performance certification. The label does
not seem to be systematically used by private consumers to disclose information on the thermal quality of a dwelling to
the market. Other quality attributes of certified dwellings, measured by the maintenance of the exterior, also lack a
consistent effect on label adoption. [11]

Column (3) of Table 2 includes neighborhood characteristics in the analysis. The results show that adoption rates are
highest among homes that are located in neighborhoods with higher densities and populated by households with lower
average incomes. Difficult selling conditions, as measured by average time on the market, are also associated with higher
adoption rates.
In the last Column, we address the environmental ideology of homeowners as a determinant of label adoption. The
literature on ideology and consumer choice provides evidence that ‘‘green’’ consumers are more likely to adopt
environmental innovations [19] and are more responsive to energy conservation ‘‘nudges’’ [8]. As a proxy for
environmental ideology, we include the fraction of votes for ‘‘green’’ parties in the 2006 national elections. This variable
is available for 479 cities. The results on voting preferences and label adoption show a significantly positive coefficient on
our measure of voting ‘‘green’’, which provides some indication that the choice for adopting the energy label may also be
driven by ideological beliefs. [12]

Summarizing, recently introduced energy labels are adopted at a steadily decreasing rate in the Dutch housing market,
which is partially driven by media sentiment. However, we also find evidence that dwelling and neighborhood-specific
characteristics significantly influence the likelihood of label adoption. Households living in more heterogeneous dwellings
(as opposed to apartments) of moderate size are more likely to have their home certified. The propensity to take out a label
also increases in neighborhoods where density is high, average monthly income is low, and voting for ‘‘green’’ political
parties is more common. Difficult housing market conditions have an association with higher adoption rates, which could
be an indication that sellers use label adoption as a ‘‘strategic’’ tool – regardless of the outcome – to resolve part of the
asymmetric information problem to facilitate the transaction process. However, sellers do not seem to adopt an energy
label to signal superior building quality to prospective buyers.

5.2. The market pricing of energy performance certificates

The premise of residential energy performance disclosure is that increased transparency through reliable information
on energy efficiency leads to the capitalization of energy efficiency in housing transactions. This capitalization should
translate into a price discount for less energy efficient homes or a premium for more energy efficient homes, where the
price effect partially depends on the discount rates used by private consumers. [13]

In estimating the effects of energy performance certification on the transaction process, we face a sample selection
issue because we observe the thermal efficiency just for a subset of the total sample of transacted dwellings. We have
reason to believe that this subset of labeled dwellings is nonrandom due to self-selection or sorting of particular homes, in
particular locations, into the sample. This sorting might bias the regression results, and we, therefore, use the Heckman

[17] two-step method that includes our self-constructed News Index as an exogenous determinant of label adoption.
Presumably, this variable is unrelated to the transaction price. [14] We first estimate a probit model on the probability of
receiving certification, similar to the model estimated in Column (4) of Table 2. We then construct consistent estimates of

11 A robustness check (results not reported) indicates that the maintenance of the interior is not related to the likelihood of label adoption either.
12 We note that we cannot control for the individual demographic characteristics of voters. Also, the voting data provides just a reflection of political
preferences at the city level, rather than political preferences of individual voters.
13 There is a large body of literature on the capitalization of energy savings in prices of appliances and homes and the discount rate used therein. See
Train [30] for an early discussion.
14 The correlation between average monthly transaction prices and the News Index is very low—0.17.

p

In the formulation represented by Eq. (2), the dependent variable is the logarithm of the transaction price per square
foot of dwelling i. X i is the vector of the hedonic characteristics of building i. [15] To control for local economic conditions, L n
is the vector of variables capturing the attributes of neighborhood n in which a dwelling is located. G i is the dummy
variable with a value of one if building i is rated A, B, or C, indicating that the home obtained a ‘‘green’’ energy label, and a
value of zero otherwise. Alternatively, G i represents the vector of the scores in the energy label, ranging from A to G (where
#### the D-label serves as the reference group). l [^] i is the inverse Mills ratio constructed based on the first step of the estimation.

To further control for locational variation in transaction prices, p p is the dummy variable with a value of one if building i is
located in province p, and zero otherwise.

Table 3 presents the results of the second stage of the Heckman model in which the logarithm of transaction price per
square foot has is related to a set of hedonic characteristics, including the inverse Mills ratio. Results are corrected for
heteroskedasticity [31] and all specifications include province-fixed effects, monthly time-fixed effects and controls for the

labeled observations in this cohort is very small.

The model in Column (1) explains some 52 percent of the natural logarithm of the transaction price based on 31,993
labeled observations. Duplex dwellings and apartments transact at discounts of 36–39 percent, relative to detached
dwellings. Selling prices are higher for smaller dwellings, although the number of bedrooms has a significantly positive
effect on price. An additional bedroom adds some 0.3 percent to the transaction price, ceteris paribus.
Age becomes valuable once it is officially recognized: dwellings that are registered as monuments sell at a premium of
about five percent.
The variables that reflect local economic conditions mostly show the expected signs: the average monthly household
income in the neighborhood has a positive relation to the transaction price, and the average time on the market in the
neighborhood has a negative relation to the transaction price. House prices seem to be lower in high-density areas.
Most importantly, within the sample of certified dwellings, we document that homes with a label A, B, or C, which are
generally referred to as ‘‘green’’ labels, transact at an average price premium of 3.7 percent, ceteris paribus. Considering that
the average transaction price of a dwelling in the certified sample equals h231,000, the euro value of the ‘‘green’’ price
premium amounts to h8449, at the point of means.
The coefficient on the selection variable, the inverse Mills ratio, is negative and significant. This result indicates that the
error terms in the selection equation and the primary equation are negatively correlated. So, (unobserved) factors that
make energy labeling more likely tend to be associated with lower transaction prices of dwellings. [16]

The second Column of Table 3 presents the results when the specific score of the energy label is included in the model.
We document that the premium for energy efficiency constitutes a series of positive price effects that correspond to
the outcomes of the different label categories. We find that A-labeled homes transact at a price premium of 10.2 percent
as compared to similar homes with the intermediate D-label, and dwellings with a G-label transact at a discount of some
5 percent.
The variation in the premium for energy efficiency seems to be related to the present value of future energy savings
resulting from higher energy efficiency. In 2009, a standardized Dutch dwelling had an average monthly energy bill of
h152, ranging between h105 for energy label A, to h231 for energy label G. Capitalizing the difference in the energy bill
of an F-labeled dwelling, compared to a G-labeled dwelling, results in a present value of h4000. [17] This is about 1.8 percent
of the average transaction price and slightly lower as compared to the average price difference between F- and G-labeled
dwellings documented in Table 3. Comparing the capitalized energy savings of A-labeled dwellings with G-labeled
dwellings yields a present value of about h16,000, or 7.2 percent of the average transaction price. Hence, the 15 percent
price premium for A-labeled dwellings (compared to G-labeled dwellings, based on coefficients reported in Table 3) seems
to reflect more than just future energy savings alone.
Part of the ‘‘green’’ increment might be explained by the better building quality of homes with an A, B, or C label.
Therefore, Columns (3) and (4) more explicitly control for differences in thermal characteristics and dwelling quality.
The results in Column (3) show that the quality of thermal characteristics has a positive effect on home prices: the
presence of central heating – now prevalent in most homes in the Netherlands – and better insulation both have
significant and positive relations with the transaction price. Central heating leads to an average increase in transaction
prices of 1.4 percent. In line with expectations, high-quality exterior maintenance positively affects property prices. This
effect is substantial: well-maintained homes transact at a price premium of 2.7 percent.
When controlling for the quality of the dwelling, the ‘‘green’’ increment decreases slightly to 3.6 percent, but it remains
statistically and economically significant. The coefficients on the energy ratings in Column (4) are slightly smaller as well,
but remain equally significant both economically and statistically.
Further, we test for the robustness of the ‘‘green’’ transaction premium over the sample period by including interaction
terms of ‘‘green’’ and quarterly time dummies in Model (2). We hypothesize that, with decreasing consumer confidence in
the energy performance certificate, the signaling value of the label might be negatively affected. Fig. 3 reports point
estimates for the average ‘‘green’’ premium per quarter, including the 95 percent confidence interval for each coefficient.
Controlling for differences in location and quality, the average price premium for homes with an A, B, or C certificate
remains relatively constant during the first year of the sample period, but drops to about zero in the first quarter of 2009.
However, the ‘‘green’’ premium increases again to 1.5 and 2 percent in the second and third quarter of 2009, respectively.
This rebound might have a relation with increased consumer confidence in the energy label following some months of
positive media coverage.
Summarizing, our results provide an indication that private consumers use the information disclosed by the energy
label and take the relative energy efficiency of their prospective home into account when making investment decisions.
This evidence adds to the small number of studies that have addressed the empirical relation between characteristics of
thermal efficiency and transaction prices of residential dwellings [9,14,22] and to studies on energy efficiency, labels,
rents, and prices in commercial buildings [10,11].

16 The regression results change slightly when the analysis is repeated without including the inverse Mills ratio. Results of this robustness check are
available from the authors upon request.
17 To calculate the present value of future energy savings, we capitalize the monthly difference between the average energy bills of dwellings with
different energy labels (A through G), assuming a duration of twelve years (the average holding period of Dutch homeowners), and a four percent
discount rate (assuming homeowners treat proceeds from future energy savings as risk-free). The Dutch Ministry of Housing provided the data on the
average energy bills of dwellings in different labels classes based on a sample of 4750 homes.

6. Conclusions

Energy efficiency improvements in the residential housing market can play an important role in the reduction of global
carbon emissions. Besides more traditional policies, such as stricter buildings codes, energy labels can be instrumental in
resolving information asymmetries regarding the energy performance of private dwellings and commercial buildings. The
information provided by energy labels may thus encourage energy conservation in the housing sector. This paper reports
the first evidence on the market adoption and economic implications of energy performance certificates using a large-scale
mandatory labeling program in the European Union. We exploit the residential sector in the Netherlands as a laboratory, as
the Dutch housing market was one of the first to experience the formal introduction of energy labels for residential
dwellings in January 2008.
Using a data set of some 177,000 transactions, we first address the implementation of energy labels in the housing
market. We find that energy labels are adopted at a declining rate, lead by negative sentiment in the public media. More
heterogeneous dwellings of moderate size, constructed post-war, and between 1970 and 1990, are most likely to be
labeled, but thermal and other quality characteristics of the home have no relation to the label adoption rate. The label is
not systematically used to signal superior dwelling quality. Neighborhood characteristics have a distinct influence on the
propensity to adopt a label: labeled dwellings are mostly located in neighborhoods where density is higher, monthly
household incomes are lower, and voting for ‘‘green’’ parties is more common. Some of the neighborhood characteristics
and the regional variation in label adoption have a relation to less competition in local housing markets (i.e., where the
average time on the market is longer). Our results imply that the initial lack of transparency in labeling practices, in
combination with the current legislation regarding energy performance certification that provides a simple escape clause,
hinders a complete uptake of energy labels in the market. As a result, the energy label is adopted in a nonrandom way.
We also study the effects of energy performance certification on the outcome of the transaction process. Controlling for
thermal and other hedonic characteristics of residential dwellings, we document that homebuyers are willing to pay a
premium for homes that have been labeled as more energy efficient, or ‘‘green’’. Our results show that this price premium
varies with the label category of the energy performance certificate and is robust to variations in housing quality. The
energy performance certificate is instrumental in creating transparency in the energy performance of a dwelling and
seems to be an effective signaling device that is capitalized into home prices.
These findings contain some important lessons for homeowners – private as well as institutional. When improving
the energy efficiency of a dwelling, there is not only an immediate financial benefit from lower energy expenses, but the
increased energy efficiency is also recognized at the time of sale, which leads to a higher transaction price. Although we
provide some intuition on relation between the size of the energy-efficiency increment and real energy savings, we are
ultimately not able to distinguish between the intangible effects of labeling itself and the economic effects of energy
savings per se. Detailed information on energy consumption of the individual households would allow us to further
disentangle these effects.
For policy makers, the results of this paper may help in refining energy performance certification programs and in
stimulating more extensive dissemination of the energy labels. This paper shows that current legislation regarding the
adoption of the label is not strong enough. The numerous opt-outs allow homeowners to avoid certification of dwellings.
For the energy performance of the complete residential stock to improve, all homes should have an energy performance
certificate. [18]

18 In fact, at the time of writing, the European Parliament had just approved new legislation to make the energy performance certificate fully
mandatory across the European Union, including elimination of the waiver-option.

The case of the Netherlands demonstrates that start-up problems surrounding the implementation of the energy label
were neither adequately tackled, nor clearly communicated by policy makers. The negative publicity that surrounded the
energy performance certification process hindered the market uptake. The resulting lack of confidence in the energy label
is costly to repair. Other governments should learn from these mistakes, because the information conveyed by a wellregarded energy labeling system seems to represent an effective market signal. This effectiveness might trigger
investments in more energy-efficient buildings, thereby reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions.
