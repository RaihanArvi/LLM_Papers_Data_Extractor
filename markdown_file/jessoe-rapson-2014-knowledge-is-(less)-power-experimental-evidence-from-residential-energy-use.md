###### Knowledge is (Less) Power:  Experimental Evidence from  Residential Energy Use [†]

*By* Katrina Jessoe and David Rapson*

*Imperfect information about product attributes inhibits efficiency in*

A key assumption underpinning central theorems in economics is that agents are
fully informed. Yet information is rarely free to decision makers. Information costs
may take many forms—time, cognitive effort, monetary expense, technological
hurdles—and are pervasive in choice settings. A growing body of literature explores
the importance of some of these information costs, demonstrating that decisions are
dramatically altered when information is conveyed in a simple way. Retirement plan
decisions change when employees are provided benefits information (Duflo and
Saez 2003); the take-up rates of government transfer programs increase among eligibles when information is provided in a simple format (Bhargava and Manoli 2013);

­consumers restrict their use of cell phone minutes when informed of approaching a
higher price tier (Grubb and Osborne 2013); and fishing markets operate more efficiently with the adoption of mobile phones, a new information technology (Jensen
2007). Even President Obama has acknowledged that decisions can be improved
through the dissemination of relevant information in some important choice settings,
as witnessed by his “College Scorecard” which provides students with comprehensive
access to information to facilitate college choice. This paper explores how an economic treatment can interact with improvements in information to enhance welfare.
The full information assumption implies that utility-maximizing consumers
can identify the trade-off between product attributes and price (e.g., Rosen 1974).
However, basic information may often be unclear. The recent literature has focused
on whether agents perfectly know and comprehend the price of a good (i.e., price
“salience”). In many settings they do not. Consumers treat taxes featured and not
featured in the posted price differently, becoming more price elastic when taxes are
salient (Chetty, Looney, and Kroft 2009); they are inattentive to opaque “add-on”
costs such as shipping and handling fees (Hossain and Morgan 2006); and drivers
become less price elastic when road tolls become less salient due to automated payment technology (Finkelstein 2009). Another setting has garnered less attention: that
in which there is uncertainty about non-price attributes (exceptions include Jin and
Leslie 2003, Gabaix and Laibson 2006). A common form of this uncertainty arises in
household choice settings, where we consume services, not inputs directly. Durable
goods that require water or energy inputs fall into this category, and markets have
a mixed record of providing information about the relationship between input and
output quantities. Advancements in car dashboard displays have increased drivers’
knowledge of the gasoline required to travel a mile (Stillwater and Kurani 2012). But
information about the household production function is lacking in other markets, leaving individuals uncertain as to how common actions like watering the lawn or cooling
a house by one degree translate into water and electricity usage. This is also observed
in caloric intake from food (Bollinger, Leslie, and Sorensen 2011, Wisdom, Downs,
and Loewenstein 2010) and carbon emissions from driving. Generally, this variety of
poor information will lead to inefficiency since households must know input requirements (not just price of inputs) to equate marginal benefit with marginal cost.
This paper assesses the importance of providing information about non-price
attributes, specifically input quantities, in a familiar setting: residential electricity
demand. Electricity customers traditionally exhibit low price elasticity (Reiss and
White 2005; Allcott 2011a; Ito 2014), but this may be due to features of the setting
that inhibit full information. Quantity consumed tends to be shrouded because of
coarse and infrequent billing making it difficult to know both electricity usage at
any moment in time and the input requirements of each appliance. Further, since
electricity comprises only a modest share of household budgets, it may be rational
for households not to invest the time and effort to resolve this uncertainty. Therefore,
it is important to distinguish whether residential electricity consumers are actually
price inelastic or just appear to be inelastic because they lack complete information.
To address this question, we conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) (a
“framed field experiment” in the terminology of Harrison and List 2004) which
exposes all treatment households to exogenous price changes. A random subset of
these households is also exposed to real-time feedback on quantity of electricity

consumed via an in-home display (IHD). The price treatments expose customers to
two- or four-hour long pricing events during which the price of electricity increased
by 200 to 600 percent, thereby allowing us to isolate the effect of price changes
alone (for households without IHDs) on usage. [2] The IHD enables customers to
inform themselves about electricity usage and price at almost zero marginal cost,
allowing them to learn about the energy requirements associated with various forms
of household production. For example, households can view their electricity load
both before and after turning off a light or running the air conditioner. Since all
­treatment households were informed of upcoming price changes via e-mail, voice
mail, or text message, the main incremental information provided by the IHD (relative to the price-only treatment) was the real-time quantity of electricity being used.
Our central result shows that providing residential electricity customers with
real-time information about energy usage increases their price elasticity of demand.
Conditional on changes in price, households exposed to information feedback consistently exhibit price elasticities that are roughly three standard deviations larger
than those without feedback. Households in the price-only group reduce their usage
by between 0 and 7 percent on average during pricing events (depending on the
amount of advance notification they received), relative to control. In contrast, those
exposed to the same price changes but who also have IHDs, exhibit much larger usage
reductions of 8 to 22 percent. The treatment gradient attributable to information is
not due to price salience, as confirmed by an analysis of event notification receipts
(the e-mails/texts/phone calls sent to households in advance of events). Instead, our
empirical evidence suggests that experience with IHDs facilitates consumer learning,
improving households’ decision making when confronted with high prices.
The treatment effects also spill over into non-event hours, both within an event day
and on non-event days. In the long run, an evaluation of trends in usage over the days
of the summer reveals that households in both the price and ­price-plus-information
groups are forming conservation habits even when events are not occurring. The
combined effects imply a social benefit in the form of potential long-run capital
efficiencies, as well as greenhouse gas abatement on the order of 1–2 percent of
emissions from the residential electricity sector.
This paper contributes to an ongoing literature that explores the effectiveness of
dynamic pricing programs in the electricity sector, an industry with over $370 billion
per year in retail sales. One of the industry’s most difficult challenges relates to the
mismatch between wholesale and retail prices within and across days, despite recent
advances in metering technologies (Borenstein 2002; Borenstein 2005; Borenstein
and Holland 2005; Joskow and Wolfram 2012). Increases in the retail price elasticity
would lead to short-run and long-run efficiency gains from market power mitigation
and improvements in capital efficiencies. Our results suggest that when coupled
with real-time feedback, price acts as an effective lever to achieve these gains.
Our main result is timely due to a recent tendency for electricity and water regulators to eschew market-based approaches in favor of non-market instruments. Electric
utilities have made social pressure a cornerstone of recent energy ­conservation efforts

2 These so-called “critical peak prices” are a variant of dynamic pricing that is intended to transmit wholesale
market price incentives to the retail sector. By design, the magnitude of our price treatments is consistent with peak
fluctuations in the wholesale electricity market.

(e.g., Opower) and federal authorities rely heavily on efficiency standards. To respond
to droughts, water authorities tend to use non-pecuniary approaches (Olmstead and
Stavins 2009). And while these programs have been shown to achieve moderate conservation (Allcott 2011b; Ferraro and Price 2013), policy makers should view price
as an effective tool to achieve their objective if consumers are informed.
The paper proceeds as follows: Section I explains the experimental setting and
research design, and Section II describes the data; empirical methods and results are
presented and discussed in Section III; Section IV describes conservation implications; and Section V concludes.

**I. Research Design**

In partnership with a regulated electric utility, The United Illuminating Company
(UI), we designed and implemented a framed field experiment that introduced shortterm price increases and real-time information to a sample of residential electricity
customers in the Bridgeport and New Haven areas of Connecticut. The treatment
events occurred in July and August of 2011, the months during which peak electricity demand strains the capacity of the grid.
To be eligible for participation in the pilot a customer needed to reside in a townhouse or single family home, have a broadband Internet connection, and sign and
return an end-user agreement indemnifying UI against litigation risk. [3] As an additional participation incentive, we offered households $40: $20 upon completion of
a pre-survey prior to assignment to treatment and $20 upon completion of a survey once the pilot ended. To recruit households into the pilot, UI e-mailed 60,000
customers that had enrolled in paperless billing, indicating the likely presence of
Internet in their home. We estimate that approximately 7,000 households opened the
e-mails. [4] Of the 7,000 or so households that received the invitation to participate,
we recruited 1,152 households (approximately 1 in 6) to participate in the project.
A subset of these households, 437, form the sample for this study. We randomly
assigned households to one of three groups: control, price (“price-only”), and priceplus-information (“price IHD”).
+

**Control Group:** A total of 207 households were assigned to the control group.
These households (and all others in the pilot) received a mailing that notified them
they were in the pilot, informed them of their group assignment, and contained an
energy conservation pamphlet documenting “101 Ways to Conserve Electricity.”

**Price-Only Treatment:** The 130 households in this group experienced pricing
events that varied in the magnitude of the price increase and the timing of event
­notification. There were two event types. The first, “DA,” provided *day-ahead*

3 Some aspects of device-to-utility communication were configured to occur wirelessly via the Internet. It was
thus important for experimental validity that *all* of the participants have wireless. Any household that upon recruitment had a wireline broadband connection instead of a wireless connection was given a wireless router.
4 It is well known that only a small fraction of households receiving these sorts of marketing e-mails actually
open them, let alone read them. While we are unable to report the exact open rate (the fraction of delivered e-mail
messages that are actually opened), 12 percent is a rule-of-thumb open rate used by industry experts. For example,

­notification that the per-kWh price of electricity would be increased by $0.50 (or a
roughly 250 percent increase over the standard rate). These events mimic a ­pricing
policy that a utility might use to transmit electricity conservation incentives when
high temperatures are expected in the following afternoon. The second type of event,
“TM,” sent notification thirty minutes before a $1.25 increase in the per-kWh price
of electricity. A utility may implement this type of policy to reduce immediate risk
in grid stability due to an unexpected decrease in generation (say, due to the failure
of a baseload generating plant). [5]

Ex ante we cannot predict to which type of event households will be more responsive. While TM events send a much stronger price signal, households may not be
able to respond to the price change within the short window of advance notification.
Between July 2011 and August 2011, three DA and three TM pricing events occurred.
All events occurred during peak hours, but there was variation in the length and exact
timing of events. Table 1 lists each event, including the start time, event duration, and
measured temperature. Households received notification of pricing events by e-mail,
phone call, and/or text message, depending on their stated preference.
Since billed electricity rates are determined through a periodic, external rate-case
process, we transmitted the experimental price incentives via an off-bill account
initially credited with $100. The difference between the regulated price and the
event price was multiplied by the quantity of electricity consumed during each event
period, and that amount was subtracted from the household’s off-bill account balance. At the conclusion of the experiment, any balance remaining in the account was
the customer’s to keep. This arrangement achieved the intended marginal incentives
while also shielding participants from bill increases attributable to pricing events.
The implementation of price changes may raise concerns about construct validity. However, the central result of the paper relates to the differential price response
between households with and without information feedback. As such, any concerns
about construct validity would apply equally to these two groups, so the treatment
differential is unaffected by the implementation of the price changes.

**Price** **+** **IHD Treatment:** The 100 households randomly assigned to this treatment
group experienced the pricing program described above, and also received real-time

5 On July 22, 2011, a prolonged heat wave on the east coast was occurring and the peak wholesale price on the
New England Independent System Operator’s (NEISO) spot market climbed to nearly $0.60/kWh. If households
on a flat rate faced a DA event on that day, the retail price would have been $0.71/kWh. A significant disruption
of supply would have compounded strain on the grid, and prices may have easily approached levels on the order of
magnitude of our experimental price changes.

information about their electricity use. This information was provided via an ­in-home
display (IHD), a portable device which can be mounted on a wall or placed on a counter
(see online Appendix figures A.1 and A.2). Households received the IHDs and professional installation free of charge. The latter ensured that displays were set up and
activated, and maximized the likelihood that participants understood how to use them.
Two separate vendors supplied the IHDs; both provided the same information in a
similar format: real-time usage, electricity price, estimated monthly usage and bill-todate. Allowing all subsequent results to differ by IHD vendor produces identical results.
The main difference between this treatment and the price-only treatment is that
customers are able to view in real time the quantity of power being consumed, the
price of electricity, and their estimated monthly bill-to-date. The device removes the
information acquisition costs involved in informing oneself about how electricityconsuming actions translate into electricity usage and expenditure. In particular,
the ability to view real-time usage provides customers with the opportunity to learn
which appliances are heavy electricity users and which are not, thereby potentially
enabling them to more fully optimize in response to price changes. Price IHD
+
households were also informed of price changes via phone, e-mail, and text, so
while the IHD displayed price in real time, the additional information conveyed
by this feature was likely minimal. We test the hypothesis that IHDs made price
changes more salient in Section IIIC.

**II. Data**

We use high-frequency meter data on household electricity usage as the primary data source. Advanced meters were installed in all participating households,
enabling electricity usage of all participants (including those that dropped out of the
study) to be collected at 15-minute intervals. The utility also collected data which
confirmed the receipt of event notifications. Lastly, we rely on data collected from
two household surveys: one prior to assignment to treatment (the “pre-survey”) and
another upon completion of the pilot (the “post-survey”). These surveys collected
data on demographic and housing unit characteristics, appliance ownership, conservation-related actions, tendency to be home during the day, and the frequency with
which households checked their IHDs.

Technical issues associated with back-end system software precluded UI from
retrieving meter data for some households until after the experiment had begun.
Roughly one-quarter of participants are absent from the billing data for at least one
event. We are not concerned about the effect of these omissions due to both the

exogenous nature of the software issue and the fact that results are quantitatively
identical irrespective of the inclusion or exclusion of these households. To make
maximum use of the variation in our data, we use the unbalanced panel (as defined
by presence in the data for at least one treatment event) in what follows. However, in
the online Appendix we provide results using the balanced sample as well.

A. *Randomization and Compliance*

Before exploring the impact of information on the price elasticity of demand,
we provide evidence to support the integrity of the randomization. Table 2 ­presents

descriptive statistics of observable characteristics by treatment group. Panel A
includes all households who initially agreed to participate in the study and panel B
is restricted to households who completed the pilot (“compliers”). A comparison across control and treatment groups indicates statistical balance in observables. Usage and rate class, characteristics provided in the UI billing data and thus
observed for all ­households, are similar across groups. [6] The availability of demographic data is ­subject to survey compliance, so the observed statistical difference in
the size of the home across groups may be due to either sampling variation or survey

6 Where data were available, we restricted comparison of usage data to the days preceding the first event (i.e.,
July 1–July 21). We found no systematic differences in mean peak and off-peak usage across treatment and control
groups. Technical difficulties prevented UI from accessing the meter data from some households until after the
first pricing event. As such this restricted sample is comprised of 99, 81, and 184 households in the price-only,
price IHD, and control groups respectively.

non- ­compliance. Still, other household characteristics do not differ across groups,
contributing to the case for balance. The table also highlights that households in our
sample are wealthier (and likely different across variables correlated with wealth)
than both the national average and the population served by the utility.
To further test the integrity of the randomization we estimate a linear probability
model regressing each treatment indicator on mean off-peak electricity usage and
rate class (flat rate versus time-of-use rate). [7] The columns labeled “Initial Group”
in Table 3 show results, where the sample is comprised of the control group and the
price group in column 1, and the control group and price IHD group in column 2.

Neither variable is statistically significant in explaining assignment to the price and
price IHD treatments. These results provide further evidence that households
+
were randomly assigned to treatments.
Some attrition occurred in each group. In total, 38 households (approximately
9 percent) did not complete the pilot. These households either moved, requested to be
removed from the study, or failed to arrange an installation appointment for the IHD.
Of the 100 households assigned to the price IHD treatment, 28 did not complete the
+
study, which we attribute to time and scheduling costs of IHD installation. In contrast,
compliance was high in the non-technology groups. Only 4 of the 207 control households and 6 of the 130 price-only households were non-compliers.
A concern raised by this asymmetry is that success or failure to schedule an
installation appointment is systematically related to the desire or ability to respond
to treatment. Consider households with no one home during working hours. These
households will have more difficulty scheduling an installation appointment, and
may also be less likely to respond to price increases that occur during ­working

7 We do not use the survey data in our randomization checks, since survey compliance was not 100 percent and
their inclusion would confound the interpretation.

hours. In this scenario, our estimated treatment effect may partly reflect that
households best able to respond to price are more likely to be in the price IHD
+
group.
We test for asymmetric attrition by estimating a linear probability model in which
we regress an indicator set equal to 1 for compliers and 0 otherwise on off-peak electricity usage and rate class. Results are presented in columns 3 (price-only) and 4
(price IHD) of Table 3. The significant coefficient on rate class for price IHD
+ +
households suggests that some selective attrition may be occurring. Household fixed
effects will strip out any time-invariant unobservables (such as rate class), and in our
analysis we use intent-to-treat (ITT) and treatment-on-the-treated (ToT) estimators
to account for asymmetries in non-compliance.

B. *Raw Data and Mean Differences*

Figures 1–6 plot raw mean hourly usage by treatment group on each of the six event
days. In these figures, mean 15-minute interval consumption is averaged across all
households in each group. The shaded area marks the period during which a pricing
event occurred. In Figure 1, for example, a DA pricing event was held between noon
and 4 PM. The commonalities between these events are evident: households exposed
to information feedback exhibit visibly lower usage during treatment events than
price-only or control households. In the hours preceding an event, hourly electricity
usage in the three groups is approximately the same, though this appears to change
over time. [8] Once the event begins, we observe a divergence in usage between the
price IHD treatment and the other two groups. Households in the price IHD
+ +
treatment use less electricity in each hour of the pricing event. Interestingly, we do
not observe visible differences between price-only and control households, despite
large price increases in the former. The figures also reveal that the treatment effect
differs from event to event, and in some cases is less visually discernible. For example, it is difficult to see differences between group outcomes in Figure 3. This may
be partly due to a smaller treatment effect on that day, or that there appear to be
similar treatment effects in the Price-only and Price IHD groups. Clear temporal
+
patterns also emerge from the plots, which are predictable features of electricity
demand given weather and lifestyle patterns.
A simple comparison of means in the raw data (Table 4) reflects what is visible in
most of the usage plots. For each event type, the control group exhibits higher mean
usage than either treatment group. The magnitude of the raw treatment effects varies by treatment and event type. Price IHD households exhibit between a 12–18
+
percent usage reduction (to all events), as compared to a 0–7 percent reduction by
price-only households. Response to DA events is higher than to TM events, providing evidence that advance notice facilitates a stronger response, even under a weaker
price incentive.

8 There is some visual evidence of potential habit formation and load-shifting affecting non-event-hour usage. In
Section IV, we test for the presence of these behaviors.

A. *Intent-to-Treat*

Panel A of Table 5 reports results from the ITT estimator in which ​ *D* *Pit* *​* and ​ *D* *Pit* + *I* *​*
​ ​ ​ ​
in equation (1) denote initial assignment to the price and price IHD treatments,
+
irrespective of compliance status. The coefficients, ​​ [] *P* *​* and ​​ [] *PI* *​*, in this specification
β ​​ β ​​
are consistent estimates of the average percentage change in electricity usage from
assignment to treatment during pricing events.
Column 1 displays results from the simple difference-in-differences model;
column 2 includes hour-by-calendar-date fixed effects; and column 3 includes
household fixed effects. In column 4, our preferred specification, we include both
household fixed effects and hour-by-calendar-date dummies, allowing us to account
for both time-invariant differences across households and aggregate hourly patterns in weather and lifestyle. Here, the coefficients of interest are identified from
­variation within households over time, controlling for aggregate hourly shocks separately for each calendar day. Finally, in columns 5 and 6 we present the effects of
DA and TM events separately, using the preferred controls.
This table makes clear that households with real-time information feedback are
significantly more responsive to price changes than those without. When DA and
TM events are pooled together (columns 1–4), households with an IHD reduce
usage by 11 to 14 percent and are over three standard deviations more responsive
to pricing events as those without IHDs (column 4). A comparison of the treatment
effect across groups highlights that the differential is robust to the controls included,
both in terms of magnitude and statistical significance. That the inclusion of household and time controls does not meaningfully alter the magnitude of treatment
effects provides further evidence for the integrity of the randomization. As shown
in Table A.1 of the online Appendix, the treatment differential is similar when we
use the “balanced” sample, suggesting that the estimated information gradient is
not sensitive to our choice of sample. These results provide strong evidence that
the cumulative effect of real-time information feedback in this setting is to increase
the price elasticity of demand. In the absence of information, the price effects are
weak. Price-only households on average decrease usage by 2 to 6 percent during
events, an effect which is not statistically significant. These results confirm the pattern illustrated in the daily plots which suggests little, if any, response to events by
uninformed households.
We break out the events separately by type (DA or TM) in columns 5 and 6, and
continue to find that households with IHDs are significantly more price elastic. The
percentage point treatment differential between households in the two treatment
groups is robust to event type and significant with 85 percent confidence. However,
individuals are more responsive, both economically and statistically, to pricing
events that occur with more advance notice. This is true despite the fact that the price
increase in TM events is more than twice that for DA events ($1.25 as compared to
$0.50). Households assigned to the price group reduce usage by 7 percent during
DA events where this response is weakly significant. In contrast, they are largely
unresponsive to TM events and if anything increase usage during these events. We
find similar patterns across event type for households assigned to the price IHD
+
treatment. With advanced notification, these households reduce usage by 17 percent as compared to an 8 percent (but not statistically significant) response with


-----

*1430* *THE AMERICAN ECONOMIC REVIEW* *APRIL 2014*

30 minute notification. Even with strong financial incentives, with only 30 minutes
of warning individuals may not have the ability to respond to a price change.

B. *Treatment on Treated*

The treatment effect on treated households (ToT) is the causal effect of the
price and price IHD treatments on compliers. The ToT specification uses initial
+
­treatment assignment as an instrument for receipt of treatment, and is estimated
using two-stage least squares. Randomization and the strong rate of compliance
ensure strength and validity of the instruments: compliance was 98 percent, 95 percent, and 72 percent in control, price-only, and price IHD, respectively.
+
Estimates of ToT specifications are presented in panel B of Table 5, where the
specification estimated in each column corresponds to those described for panel A.
Again, we find that information feedback meaningfully impacts the usage response
to pricing events. Compared to the ITT estimates, the magnitude of the treatment
effect and treatment differential are slightly larger. In our preferred specification
(column 4), households with IHDs are 13 percentage points (3–4 standard deviations) more responsive to pricing events than those without, where this differential is
present with 95 percent confidence. Households in both treatment groups are more
responsive to advance notification events, and we continue to observe a treatment
differential with over 85 percent confidence when estimating event types separately.
Many readers may wish to see these results presented as elasticities, which is of
course mathematically possible. The implied arc elasticities are low at less than

−
0.12. However, it is unclear as to what information is actually conveyed by these statistics due to the magnitude of the price increases: 200 percent during CPP events and
600 percent during DR events. The range of the price increases may contain regions
of highly elastic demand as well as regions of inelastic demand, allowing for the possibility that lower price changes may induce the same absolute behavioral response.

C. *Secondary Results and Robustness*

Potential explanations for the strong information effect are many. The hypothesis
that we believe is most consistent with observed behavior is that experience with
the display facilitates learning about energy choices, and in particular the mapping
of these choices to expenditure. This mechanism is consistent with a framework in
which baseline information about quantity is imperfect, and whereby IHDs serve to
inform consumers and (in doing so) influence their subsequent choices. In this section, we first present some evidence that attempts to rule out the leading alternative
hypothesis—that IHDs generate more awareness of price, and consumers who possess them become more price responsive for this reason. We then provide some evidence consistent with the hypothesis that consumers learn through experience with
the IHDs, and that this plays an important role in the treatment differential. In the
online Appendix, we also explore the practical mechanisms by which households
respond to price changes and find that, while different household characteristics are
correlated with customer response, they are not driving the information gradient.
In some of the analyses that follow, we use data collected from the pre- and
­post-surveys, thereby limiting the sample to households that completed them. As such


-----

*VOL. 104 NO. 4* *JESSOE AND RAPSON: KNOWLEDGE IS* ( *LESS* ) *POWER* *1431*

the estimates may be vulnerable to differences in survey non-compliance across groups
that are also correlated with unobservables; we discuss this in the online Appendix.
A second caveat in the specifications is that we interact treatment indicators with survey responses that are themselves outcome variables. The results that follow should be
viewed as cross-tabulations of the treatment effect with various survey responses.

*Notification and Awareness of Price Events* .—A plausible alternative to the
“learning” hypothesis is that IHDs facilitate a heightened awareness of price events.
Our experimental design sought to control for this by making electricity price
changes salient. This was achieved by having the utility send all customers in the
price and price IHD groups notification in the form of a combination of a text
+
message, e-mail and/or phone call in advance of each event. The messages alerted
households of the event and informed them what the price would be. Still, we would
like to test that there is no additional awareness effect from the IHDs that is driving
the main treatment differential. One indicator that customers were aware of pricing
events would be if they actually received notification of them. If for some reason,
notifications were not received, it becomes more plausible that the IHD may provide
incremental awareness of pricing events (making it more difficult to rule out the
price salience mechanism).
For each pricing event, the utility collected data confirming the receipt of event
notification and documenting the extent to which notification information was conveyed if notification was not confirmed. To acknowledge notification of an event,
a household needed to a push a button on the telephone at the end of an automated
phone call (informing customers of an event) or click a button confirming receipt
of a notification e-mail. These events, as well as households who had notifications
texted to them, were defined as confirmed. The remaining events were classified as
not confirmed or intermediate, where the latter category includes instances when
someone answered the phone but hung up before manually confirming receipt or
when an automated message was left on a voice mail. We classify this intermediate
group as confirmed. As shown in Table A.2 in the online Appendix, awareness of
the events was high, suggesting that the treatment events were front-of-mind for a
majority of households.
Were the differential response to exist because IHDs increase awareness of price
events, then we would expect to see that, conditional on confirmation, households
in the two groups would respond equivalently. To test this hypothesis, we estimate

­notifications are important, as households confirming receipt of them exhibit a larger
response overall and for the DA events. We also see that confirmation of event notification alone cannot explain the treatment differential between those with and without
IHDs. Conditional on confirmation of event notification, we reject the null that the
coefficient estimates are equal with 95 percent confidence overall, and with 90 and
85 percent confidence when estimating DA and TM events separately. At the same
time, conditional on no confirmation we find a statistically indistinguishable response
across the price and price IHD groups. This suggests that IHDs do not appear to
+
be either informing households of events or enabling unaware households to respond.

*Experience* .—We have shown that awareness does not account for the information
gradient in price response, and in the online Appendix discuss alternate hypotheses
which also fail to explain the gradient. We now hypothesize that IHDs facilitate learning about the electricity usage associated with the portfolio of household production
alternatives. To the extent that customers observe and interact with the IHD, they are
gaining information about features of the mapping between electricity-consuming
actions and the electricity inputs that they require. For example, if a consumer views
the display before and after turning on her air conditioner (or light), she will notice
that it consumes a large (or small) amount of electricity. This knowledge, if accumulated for multiple appliances, better equips households to respond to price changes.
To test if frequent experience with the IHD increases price responsiveness, we use
responses from the post-survey that asked, “How many times per week did you look

at the IHD in the first month that it was activated?” Note that IHDs were installed
two to four months before the first pricing event occurred, leaving ample time for
households to interact with them before the treatment events occurred. Table 7 shows
that most households frequently experimented with their IHD in the first month that
they received it. Conditional on answering this question, only 6 percent of respondents did not look at it and approximately 65 percent of respondents looked at it
more than 5 times.
In columns 2–4, we present results from the estimation of equation (2), where
the sample is restricted to control households and households with an IHD, and ​ *A* *i* *​*
​
is now a vector of indicator variables describing how frequently a household looks
at the IHD. Households who engage most frequently with the IHD are significantly
more responsive to price changes than others. [10] This evidence suggests that more
frequent experience with the IHDs facilitates learning about the quantity of electricity consumed by energy consuming durables. Still, it is possible that the households
inherently more responsive to price also happen to look at the IHDs more frequently.
If this is the case then unobservables may bias the estimates.

10 Households reporting never to look at the displays have large measured responses as well. However, these are
few in number and there are potentially reasonable explanations (e.g., principal-agent problems, or conservation
responses that do not require knowledge of trade-offs on the intensive margin, like leaving the home).

**IV. Conservation Implications**

Despite confining the pricing events to small periods in time, the treatments produce behavioral responses which extend beyond events. These occur in both the
short run (hours adjacent to the price event) and the medium run (on non-event days
over the course of the summer). In the short run, activities undertaken in response to
high prices spill over into the hours preceding and following the events, resulting in
lower usage outside of the treatment window. This result is highlighted in Table 8,
which reports estimates from the preferred ITT specification but with the addition of
indicator variables for the two hours preceding and following price events for each
treatment group. In the hours preceding and following an event, price households
exposed to DA notification exhibit no change in usage, while those with feedback
significantly reduce usage by 10 percent. In contrast, we find no significant evidence
of spillovers (or load shifting) in response to TM events, likely because households
have limited time to prepare for them. Our results provide no evidence of load shifting, suggesting that the conservation experienced during events is not offset by
increases in usage in adjacent non-event hours.
In the medium-term (weeks to months) as households are exposed to multiple
events their usage decreases in meaningful ways on non-event days. This effect
translates into measurable conservation on non-event days over the months of the
study. To explore these effects, we restrict the sample to include only non-event days
for the balanced panel of households and estimate the following specification:

Table 9 reports the ​ *g*, *hod* *​* coefficients from equation (3), with each row reflecting

the estimated trend associated with each hour of day. For example, row 1 displays the
trend in kWh for the period noon to 1 PM, implying an average daily decrease (gradient) in usage of 0.23 percent for price-only households during this noontime hour.
This corresponds to a 14 percent decrease in usage on August 31 relative to July 1. At
the upper end of the coefficient range, conservation effects are equivalent to 24 and 21
percent during 7–8 PM for the price-only and price IHD groups, respectively. We

find that the conservation trend is steeper for price IHD households in early hours,

but late in the peak period, price-only households exhibit a larger change in usage.
Taken together, three observations emerge from these non-event period results.
First, our main estimates of the treatment affect are attenuated. Given that identification comes from within household variation, reductions in usage outside the
event window will lower the baseline against which the event-period effects are

compared. [11] Further, since spillovers are stronger for price IHD households, the
+
treatment differential will also be attenuated, implying an even larger gradient of
information feedback on price elasticity. Second, given the magnitude of the main
treatment differential during the price events, it is noteworthy that habit formation
across the two groups over non-event days is quite similar. This contrast in results
may suggest that recurring price events induce a cumulative response in the ­medium
run irrespective of the presence of information feedback, but that the information
enables a more sophisticated and precise response to short-run incentives.
The third observation is that the incremental contribution of the price treatments
extends beyond load reductions during critical periods, conferring environmental benefits in the form of greenhouse gas abatement. Both in the short run and medium run
we find that the cumulative effect of treatment results in electricity conservation. The
magnitude of conservation associated with behavior during the actual pricing events is
likely to be negligible, given their short duration and infrequency. However, habits that
form in the medium run may lead to measurable changes, amounting to approximately
a 1–2 percent reduction in residential electricity sector carbon dioxide emissions. [12]

**V. Conclusion**

This paper reinforces the importance of information when non-price attributes of
the choice setting are imperfectly known to consumers. Using residential electricity markets as the empirical setting, our experimental results show that information
feedback about electricity usage increases the price elasticity of demand. Evidence
suggests that feedback helps consumers to learn about the input requirements of
their energy-consuming home durables. The incremental contribution of this information is both economically and statistically meaningful: a three standard deviation
increase in the behavioral response.
Our results contribute to ongoing energy policy discussions about the ability of
price to influence consumer demand. The ever-decreasing cost of information technology indicates that a major obstacle to price-based solutions—poorly informed
consumers—is becoming surmountable. This implies that when combined with feedback, price may be an efficient tool to address the challenges that characterize the
electricity industry. For example, dynamic retail pricing can be used to reduce longterm capital investments, align marginal costs and marginal benefits in the short run,
and mitigate market power (when consumers are price elastic). Further, evidence
that price events cause overall conservation will lead to greenhouse gas abatement
equivalent to 1–2 percent of emissions from the residential electricity sector.

11 To test if the primary treatment effects are attenuated, we restrict the sample to include only (i) event days and
(ii) non-event days that precede the first pricing event, and estimate our preferred specification. Results are shown
in Table A.3. Compared to the results shown in Table 5, the treatment effect increases (in absolute terms) for both
price-only and price IHD households. This suggests that conservation on non-event days attenuates the primary
+
treatment effects reported earlier.
12 Many assumptions are required to reach this estimate. Mainly, we assume that the conservation attributable
to habits at the end of our treatment period (August 31) persists through a full summer season and is generalizable
across all regions in the continental United States. We apply this electricity reduction during the hours of 4–8 PM,
and use regional estimates of the hourly marginal load and hourly C ​O 2 ​ emissions of the marginal generator from
FERC Form 714 and the analysis by Graff Zivin, Kotchen, and Mansur ​(2013), respectively. Details of these calculations are available from the authors upon request.

More broadly, these results confirm the practical importance of one of economics’ most ubiquitous assumptions—that decision makers have perfect information.
Other important choice settings share features that make these findings broadly
relevant. Providing consumers with information about the quantity of frequently
consumed goods such as water, ­calories, or greenhouse gas emissions may improve
private efficiency. However, the direction of social benefits may be setting-specific.
While in our setting information makes consumers more price elastic, in other settings consumers may realize that they consume too little or are too price responsive.
If there are externalities in these markets, then this response will make private decisions more efficient but may increase social costs.
